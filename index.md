## Background

The Spire is a school for learning magic and martial skills to better be suited to serving the people or improving the practices. It is very exclusive for entering, as it requires the approval of both headmasters who seek talent, potential, and intrigue. It is a tall tower for its main building, with a large yard outside of it called the Court, and a centered circular area outside the front of The Spire floored with tan bricks called the Yard. Its front gate connects to the main road of Bridgetown, a business center that revels in being connected to the Spire, as they provide services to The Spire in exchange for assistance with personal requests from the students. All of this rests above a bay of ocean on a column of rock connected only by the arch of Bridgetown. There are more columns with smaller buildings that connects to the Spire, but this houses residential and recreational buildings for students and visitors. The Spire consists of where classes are held. It is an 7 story tall spire, and the column it rests on is 300 ft above water level.

There are other staff as well, who work at the spire outside any sort of academic purpose. A quartermaster, a cleric, a clerk, 2 cooks, 3 groundskeepers, a librarian, and a harbormaster. Each of these people hire off and on as the season demands of course. sometimes students, sometimes from Bridgetown, and sometimes as a favor to somebody coming to seek experience from them and they were able to convince them to be given a shot. Additionally at times new faces can be seen for a month or 2 at a time assisting the headmasters as errand runners but they never stay on school grounds.

You will attempt a roll with each skill, and your collective results determine your grades. However, you must also get at least passing with more than half of your skills (10 of them). If you are proficient in a specialty subject, you gain an additional roll per specialty subject that will replace your lowest roll(s).
