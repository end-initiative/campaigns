## Levels

Characters start at level 2, with a choice to take standard array system but replace the 8 with a 10. Character progression will use the milestone leveling system.

## Allowed Races

- All from the players handbook excluding tiefling varient
- Changeling
- Firbolg
- Air and Earth Genasi
- Kenku
- Satyr
- Tabaxi (but can't be a monk)

## Classes

I would appreciate if subclasses from Fall of Faerun were tried to aid me in seeing how they perform, but Player's Handbook subclasses, Xanathar's subclasses, and Artificer are allowed. Tasha's is allowed as well.

## Spells

Spells found in Player's Handbook, Xanathars, Tasha's, and Fall of Faerun are allowed.

## Equipment

You may use all equipment found in the Player's Handbook, Xanathars, and Fall of Faerun.

Do note that new weapons and armor are available in the Fall of Faerun. Take whatever combination of your starting equipment you wish, but you cannot sell it before the game starts. Additionally, merchants are going to be more stingy about buying used goods in this world, so be warry when you decide how to build yourself. We will be playing with the shield varient equipment, but you cannot take a varient shield as a starting shield. Though you can pay extra gold at the start to make it so you can start with a varient shield.

## Feats

I will be allowing you to take a feat for free at your 3rd level, so be prepared for that. Feats available from the continued aforementioned resources are allowed.

## Additional Notes

- There will be no starting magic items.
- There is no unusual bearing on the conditions of religion or magic in this world.
- Characters should all be around 16, give or take a year or two. Or be the equivalent of 16 in human years compared to their race.
- You all will have gone to the same public school together as friends in a capital city, so there shouldn't be any extreme poverty cases. Consider your upbringing middle class. If you want, think of your parents as well and what they do.
- The district you are all from is Camreo.
- Everyone will be working towards a common goal involving a system that requires gold investment
- The established world finds itself in an era following the divine intervention of 2 deities who appeared all of a sudden to quell the feuding of others. Though there is no single theocracy, some lords and kingdoms have chosen to worship these new beings themselves. Your city does not persecute for not being devote. (If you desire more information on these beings for the purpose of your character, reach out to me).
- DONT FORGET YOUR BACKGROUND
