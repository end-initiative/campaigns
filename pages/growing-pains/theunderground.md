# The Underground

The Underground of Olerann was created out of a desire to make full use of Grydion Mountain. The residents here have a reputation for wanting to keep their business to themselves, and aren't afraid to protect it too. It is just a stereotype however, as sometimes its just what some people can afford in the city. During its excavation, a reinforcement of Grydion Castle was performed, and a vast amount of space and rooms were created underneath the existing structure in what most people call The Foundation. around this, the city has grown considerably, and maintains a unique position of autonomy for their everyday affairs, but still are governed properly by the Olerann City council. There are special luminescent trees imported in from dwarvern lands to provide some natural lighting, but there are also specially made street lights throughout the city that mages are hired to walk a route of the city and fill with the *Light* spell. These lightposts have been augmented to be able to hold onto the *Light* spell specifically for up to 8 hours after it would normally end, requiring only a few mages to be required for this task. To keep the air within the Underground fresh, there are special channels built into the ceiling that collect into pressurized chambers near the surface. Mages are again hired to create vacuums for these chambers that perform the final expulsion of air out of the chambers and Underground to the open air of Grydious Mountain. This practice simultaneously pulls fresh air into the city via the tunnels. This task is performed about every 3 hours, and helps residents keep track of about what time of day it is, since many hang wind chimes to be their alarm for when the fresh air has arrived.

## Underground Districts

### Crawling District

Probably the least trafficed district of the Underground, the Crawling districts unnoffical motto would probably be "Mind your business". Most of the residents here are known for being up there in the years, and unhappy with the growth the Underground has gone these last few decades. If you don't have business, it is best to move along so that nobody tries to chase you off for loitering.

### Gode Grotto

Originally intended to be a residential district, Gode Grotto became more associated with some illegal taverns and brothels that popped up around the time of its opening. While those practices have since been shut down, the reputation stuck, and the atmosphere is still the same despite not officially offering any of the old services. Deals are just performed now on an indiviual person to person basis with an understanding of where to look.

### Horseshoe District

Actually named the Hoswin District, everyone refers to this collection of housing as the Horseshoe District for its shape. As with most of the Underground, the housing here is cheap and simple, but the hidden charm of this place is the start-up theatre they have called Our Amatuer Hour, which allows anyone and everyone to enjoy relaxing drinks and have their shake at reciting poetry, regaling a story, or sharing a song.

### Lerideth District

Not much is associated with Lerideth District. Most citizens would tell you that its got too many people since it has two of the more accessible tunnels into the Underground. Once in a while they get a street performer trying to earn a few copper, but otherwise it is a pretty good place to just feel neutral.

### Little Run

Little Run was originally supposed to be the end of the expansion of the Underground, but as Olerann found success and more and more people were seeking to move in, the old Monarchy decided it would be better to grow out the Underground than expand the city borders and risk upsetting the Fey that still inhabit the Armagh Forest

### Miners Plateau

The Miners Plateau used to contain a mine shaft that delved deep into Grydion Mountain, but has since been sealed up when creatures kept appearing within the passages, despite no new excavation being done or other entrances being created. Now it is a popular drinking hub for the Underground, sporting many a bar dive with the freshest of dwarven cuisine.

### Mountain Rise

Mountains Rise is the first step of the expansion and property value increase of the nobles who redid Valla Center and Zuru district. It isn't much of a surprise considering it and Sierra valley access the tunnels that lead to their fancy new districts. Current efforts being performed are just painting the old stone, fixing blemishes to buildings, and buying up less desirable businesses in the hope of finding more appropriate clientele.

### Peaking Commons

The Peaking Commons were added into the Underground as a call to increase available affordable housing in Olerann. It lacks any uniqueness to it, and the multistory condos offer an unintentional claustrophobic feeling to the area. But the living is cheap, and there is talk of expanding near it.

### Plinth Village

The oldest residential district of the Underground, the people here managed to not be left to deteriorate to a shamble of a district like some would argue Dokin has. through protests and complaints, they arguably are single handedly responsible for the city still funding and supplying the Underground with what it needs. The most important people of the Underground live here with the intent of making sure nobody living under the mountain is thought of as someone elses problem.

### Renegade Way

Being the largest district in the Underground, Renegade Way is another renamed district by the public. Originally dubbed Renddig Way, this was the first district in the Underground that became deeply associated with crime rings. To this day, gangs still run business on this shelf, but have since wised up to not keep all their eggs in one basket since making the place infamous.

### Sierra Valley

Just a few decades ago, Sierra Valley would have been described as another Lerideth district, but thanks to the efforts of the nobles across the tunnels this district holds, money has been getting funneled their way to improve the area in both visuals and residents. A fact that some of the other districts have not been too keen to.

### Silver Heights

The first expansion done by Olerann to add dense living spaces to the Underground, Silver Heights establishes itself as shared living of moderate conditions. The accommodations are nice enough that nary a person complains, but you should be comfortable with the fact that ou wil be sharing your living quarters outside your personal room with more people. Lately the place has been filling up with the less commonly represented races of Olerann such as Changelings and Dragonborn

### Top Corner

Top Corner is the unofficial latest expansion of the Underground. Due to some clerical errors, a company of miners were allowed to start excavating the corner of Gode Grotto and people immediately started arranging for buying houses there. It wasn't until  3 high density buildings were constructed, and excavations were still expanding that someone in the government noticed the lack of authorization and halted the project. Since it was their own fault partly, Parliament agreed to allow the planned residencies for the corner to be built as ordered and paid for already between the private sectors, but further excavating was to stop. and thus, the small district of "Top Corner", as dubbed by Parliament during their talks, was born.

### Watchers Shelf

Watcher's Shelf is considered to be the fancy slums of the Underground. The buildings here reach from the floor to the ceiling, and one building houses a minimum of 10 residents. if you consider yourself a people lover, living here will change that real quick.
