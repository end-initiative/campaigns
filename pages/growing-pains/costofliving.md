As you continue to run your Guild, there are certain things you will have to pay to various sources to maintain your business

# City Taxes

To operate within the city, you must pay a property tax every month to the Bureau of Business and Trade. For the most part, this will come at the cost of 100gp for the location of your business. This is prone to increase and decrease based on happenings for the kingdom as a whole, but you will be informed about changes with at least a months notice. As you acquire additions to your Guild via acquisitions of other properties, or the expansion of an existing property, this price will permanently increase. Currently, only two expansions of your property are available, but more may become available as opportunities present themselves.

| Taxable Property     | Cost  |
| -------------------- | ----- |
| The Guild            | 100gp |
| Added Basement       | 15gp  |
| Neighboring Building | 95gp  |

# Guild Members

You may consider hiring extra hires during the course of your venture, and these members can provide services to the guild and/or act an additional adventurer who can take up work the guild gets during the time between playing sessions. In order to maintain an operational business, the Guild's employees must be taken care of. Depending on the nature of a hire, their pay will differ, but all members are expected to be given enough money for food and drink every week. Keep track of the total expenses you have from taking on members. People looking for work in your type of setting are hard to find the lower your appeal is. if an opportunity to hire one shows up, give it some thought as you don't know when you will next find another hire.

| Hire Type              | Cost for a week |
| ---------------------- | --------------- |
| Adventurer (Dangerous) | 8gp             |
| Adventurer (Casual)    | 4gp             |
| Alchemist              | 4gp             |
| Bard                   | 1gp             |
| Bartender/Cook         | 4gp             |
| Clerk                  | 2gp             |
| Healer                 | 1gp             |
| General Help           | 5sp             |
| Weapon Smith           | 3gp             |

Each hire beyond the original 7 members requires 1gp per week for food and drink.

Below are descriptions on what each hire type provides to the Guild

**_Adventurer (Dangerous)_**
Can be sent on missions that obviously will include some danger. You can only have as many adventurers hired as you have beds in the Guild.
**_Adventurer (Casual)_**
Can only be sent on missions that at a surface level, don't necessarily include danger. Can be killed if the mission turns out to be too much. You can only have as many adventurers hired as you have beds in the Guild.
**_Alchemist_**
you can only hire an alchemist if you have an Alchemy Lab added to your Guild. Alchemists will once per week give you 2 potions from a table of 10 possibilities. The created potions only last for 10 days. Adds 2 appeal to the Guild
**_Bard_**
if you hire a Bard to hang out in your guild, they can grace you with various performances of your request. If you started your day in the Guild with the Bard, you gain a +1 bonus to your first ability skill check made during that day. Adds 4 appeal to your guild.
**_Bartender/Cook_**
You can only hire a Bartender/Cook if you have the Storage Room Kitchen added to your Guild. A Bartender and cook can better make use of the food bought for guild members. Changes the cost of food and drink per hire to 6sp. All adventurers who partake in the Bartender/Cooks meals will leave the Guild with 1d4 temporary hit points once per day. Adds 2 appeal to the Guild
**_Clerk_**
you can only hire a Clerk if you have the Clerking Desk added to your Guild. The Clerk will take care of any running of paperwork that you may encounter for you, and make sure all payments are taken care of on time. During the month, they will find exceptions and exemptions in the tax code for your group as you take on missions that qualify for city programs and will save you 1d20 worth of gold pieces on your owed taxes per month. Adds 1 appeal to the Guild.
**_Healer_**
A healer will randomly come to check in on your base once per day and stick around for 3 hours to see if anyone needs a _Cure Wounds_, _Protection from Evil and Good_, _Purify Food and Drink_, _Lesser Restoration_, or _Protection from Poison_ applied to them. They will have 4 first level and 2 second level spell slots. When they show up will randomly be determined by the DM per day between 6am and 7pm using a 1d12 dice roll.
**_General Help_**
This hire is a part time hire that handles unspecified jobs that don't quite fit other roles. They are not particularly skilled in any aspect, but can be used to keep watch on an area of a city, run errands to the market for common equipment, and similar types of tasks you can think of. They do not cost nearly as much as a full time hire and does not require the weekly food cost, but only offer their services from 8am-12pm.
**_Weapon Smith_**
If you can gain the favor of a Weapon Smith, you can make an arrangement where someone will come at a specified time and day to pick up any weapons you desire to be taken in for servicing. Weapons that are taken will be unavailable for a day, but will be dropped off first thing in the morning. These serviced weapons will gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls for the next 5 attacks performed by them. Because this is a contract deal, you must pay the Weapon smith's wage every week, even if you did not end up using their services.

You may on occasion run into extra weekly costs that extend beyond these listed, so be aware of how full your coffers are.
