# Olerann: The Capital City of the Grydius Kingdom

Olerann is a city built on the principle of it being a new start to a new kingdom that isn't beholden to the traditions and habits that all other find themselves in frequently. While Olerann itself is a small city, it proved to the neighboring kingdoms that its people were loyal and capable enough to resist their old monarchy and start out fresh. As such, many races from across the land ended up flocking to the city looking to start their new beginnings alongside a new kingdom. Centuries later, this city has remained the  melting pot it built itself off of, and flourished to be known as a place where no one race is meant to rule over the others, and anyone can believe in anything.

Surrounding Olerann are many smaller towns and villages, but also a forest known to house some fey named Armagh. The city has a relationship with the fey of the forest which has only grown stronger since Aneanan was handed the crown. The vast acres of farmland that serve to feed the kingdom peacefully live as neighbors to this forest, though there is the occasional incident that needs sorting out.

The other neighboring features are the two entities that exist along the Nether Ridge: The Nether Mines and the Horn Enclave. The Nether Mines is the newer mine that opened in order to supply raw materials to Olerann, with the previous mine being inside the Underground of the city itself. The Nether Ridge mountains have a steady supply or iron, copper, and tin, but also occasionally offers pockets of Adamantine as a huge commodity for the city. The Underground and The mining operations of both mines would not have been possible without the Horn Clan dwarves. In exchange for their services of getting them started, the dwarves of the Horn Clan were gifted a single mountain spire to create an enclave within as a sort of embassy in the Grydius Kingdom. In addition to being an embassy, the clan has doubled their spire to act as a high security vault for clients of a higher pedigree. Thanks to this, Olerann experiences a healthy amount of traffic from nobles, political figures, and other people of renown who come to use the services of the Horn Clan.

## City Districts

### Anchor Row

Used to be the most popular district of the city back when it was first founded. Anchor Row contains the docks and the freshest fish market in town; or so people like to say. It is also home to many a cheap bar and inn. Thanks to Anchor Market at its most Northwest direction, this Districts narrowly avoids being considered a slum.

### Boardwalk Way

One of the more touristy spots of the city, this district boasts an incredible ocean view with coastline businesses for food and fine textiles. Living here is rather expensive, but it is one of the cities 2 most popular districts

### Camreo District

Being mostly Residential, Camreo enjoys a separated location that avoids foot traffic of the masses. Many a family strives for neighborhoods like this, as it is enclosed enough among itself that kids carry on and play without much worry.

### Dokin Commons

The Dokin Commons were built to support the docks with warehouses and cheap living for the travelling sailors. Nowadays, the sailors who come prefer the brighter, cleaner parts of the city, leaving the taverns and inns to be converted to very cheap housing for the city. In a way, you get what you pay for. The bells that ring as the ships start mooring and constant fish smell are not conditions many strive for.

### East Village

East village started as a business district, but lost appeal due to its location for where the clientele moved to as the city grew. Nowadays, it serves as a gathering location for many religious groups to seek a more convenient place of worship for those living on the East end of town. There used to be numerous scuffles between groups disagreeing on their various beliefs, so an access to the City Guard wall was added for quick responses and there are patrols now. Since then, there are no meaningful problems between any of the groups.

### Feros District

This district houses many of the larger corporate offices that run the controlling entities of the cities market life. Accountants, tax advisers, book keepers, and even limited insurance providers make their living off the success, or failure, of the many nobles and entrepreneurs who seek their fortune. Despite the air of business only the properties here would like to give off, most of the buildings accommodate living quarters and are used by the business owners.

### Grydion Castle

Grydion Castle used be known as Grydion Bastion. It was built to serve as a center fortress against invading kobold forces over 1000 years ago. For a long time, it served as a palace for the King to rule from, but has since lost its purpose a little as the current king chooses to not be involved in the general ruling of the kingdom, and instead serves as a tie-breaker on governance disputes, and leader under conflict. It is still not open to the public, as political leaders, emissaries, and envoys live here or visit often.

### Grydion Gates

Grydion Gates serves as the official path to head up to Grydion Castle and Parliament. The open square surrounding it amongst the town provided a natural gathering area for decrees and decisions to be announced to the people and to hold conferences.

### Jajavan Center

Jajavan Center has the luxury of being the prime shopping location for many in Camreo district and North Point. They have a healthy amount of merchants come through their way to make some quick cheaper sales as they make their wa to Lunar Plaza, so in some regards, they get the first pick of the crop. Many mom and pop shops find themselves split between here and Zuru district

### Kildin Commons

If you absolutely want to live close to Lunar Plaza, or work for the city guard, Kildin commons is the go to residential area. It is rather expensive, and only offers middle class living quarters for residents to rent, but the location and perks are what drive the prices. It also has one of the 3 large parks within the city that is famous for the Tenthday Market that runs every Tenthday.

### Lunar Plaza

Lunar Plaza is the town center for market gatherings and festivals. It lofts a wid open tiled courtyard with a moon mosaic in the floor. On nights with a full moon, the tiles absorb the moonlight and glows with a silent brilliance that makes it a popular date spot. Many cafes and restaurants surround the plaza and are amongst the most expensive properties in the city.

### Main Street Hollow

Despite being so close to the gates into the city, Main Street Hollow actually is known for being a good place o live if you want to live a secluded life within the city walls, but not give up the sky for the underground. They are modest homes with simple accommodations. and mostly go ignored for maintenance by the city. Not on purpose, they just sor tof forget about them frequently.

### Main street Way

Main Street Way benefits from being the first stop of most travellers who come to Olerann. Despite its unquestionable foot traffic, it mainly contains bussinesses for the middle class and has an abundance of smaller boutiques and pleasantry eateries like bakeries and jerky makers.

### Natuc Park

Natuc Park is home to a beautiful botanical garden in the middle of the park upheld by a combination of the city, and a private club of enthusiasts known as The Fuschia Foundation. The garden has tons of support from the public, herbalists, and medical professionals. The latter two parties contribute to the Fuschia Foundation in order to be allowed a small share of the rare and fickle plants they maintain year round. A member of parliament once tried to redirect funds and property protection for the park; he lost his seat the next election over that move.

### North Point

The residencies in North Point are from the time of old wealth. Only single family homes are found here, and most enjoy a higher quality of living compared to their neighbors. However, in terms of Olerann, they would not be considered the rich part of town, despite what some of these residents would like to argue.

### Oak Wood Village

Oak Wood Village contains many homes and businesses that are tightly packed together. It is a miniature maze for those unfamiliar with its twists and turns, but the community here is matches this aesthetic with how tightly knit they act. If you mess with someone from Oak Wood, be prepared to mess with all of Oak Wood.

### Parliament

The Parliament building was formerly the Grand Hall to Grydion Castle, and is now the main legislative hub for the Grydion Kingdom. Parliament consists of 30 members with seats being granted based on the statistics of race, the population of the cities, and the demographics of both. Currently in Parliament there are 7 Humans, 5 Elves, 5 Dwarves, 4 Halflings, 4 Gnomes, 1 Firbolg, 1 Tabaxi, 1 Half-Orc, 1 Dragonborn, and the biggest upset of the last election was a Changeling was selected to a seat by beating the incumbent Goliath. Parliament holds elections every 5 years

### Pavish Heights & Tursit Ridge

Pavish Heights and Tursit Ridge previously were neighborhoods similar to North Point, but was bought by a couple of nobles who demolished and redeveloped the land to be residencies of wealth and luxury. The communities of these two neighborhoods have an exclusive contract with the Venturing Sun guild for protection and the settling of neighborhood disruption. The only difference between the two districts is that Pavish Heights exclusively houses manors and estates, and Tursit Ridge has extremely upscale single dwellings as well.

### Valla Center

Valla Center is home to the Venturing Sun guild, as well as Valla Lake which is favorite excursion spot. Thanks to requests by the Venturing Sun, normal citizens are allowed to train in a specified part of the park while a guild member is on duty; one merely needs to ask. Real weapons are not allowed at all however.

### Zuru District

The Zuru District comfortably holds itself to the moniker of "Everyone's last stop". Many a specialized product, or unique service are housed and offered here. The district coincidentally grew into that role, and once some fo the businesses leaned into that motif, the tradition has continued to try and keep Zuru a strange collection of business. Need someone to dye and fade your sensitive Tabaxi fur for an upcoming date? Zuru has you covered.
