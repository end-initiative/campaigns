As an unorthadox means to test you for an early graduation into Hawks, the Headmasters wish to see how well you can perform the duties of a teacher to Fletchlings. You are the first of a new test group of hierarchy, now dubbed Falcons. You each can choose to teach the students in a skill or specialty subject you have at least a +3 in. Fletchlings will take tests just like you that is determined by their collective knowledge and skills (to be referenced as the Knowledge Pool), and their performance as an overall group will determine your standing. You will each have to teach 1 class a week on your own free time, using up that time slot. by teaching students, you will roll 1d20 and need a match a DC of 10 - (your bonus to the skill you are teaching) to successfully relay what you are teaching, and your students must succeed on an a d20 roll of their own with a DC of 13 - (your bonus to the skill you are teaching) to comprehend what you are teaching. If the students match the DC, all of them understand it and 3 points are awarded towards their knowledge pool. If they fail the DC within 1 of the DC, 2 points are earned, failing within 2 of the DC earns 1 point, and anything more than 2, no points are earned and they failed to understand what you were trying to teach.

Students can only be taught 1 skill and specialty subject a week, even if taught by different teachers, so coordinate if you want the most efficiency.

If by exam time, their knowledge pool is 45 or more, All the students will pass, and you each will be awarded 50 gold off your tuition. If their knowledge pool is equal to or higher than 35, but below 45, a majority will pass, and you will each earn 20 gold. If their knowledge pool is less than 35, too many failed to be acceptable, and you will be taken out of standing for becoming a Hawk.
