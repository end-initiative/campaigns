## Using the Artificer

  Enchantments are  magical effects that are studied and researched to such an extent that they are able to be placed onto any or most  items, weapons, or armor. Not many people are able to perform the artificing needed for such effects, and thus their creation are valuable.
  At The Spire, the artificer is a service performed by the school itself that students are able to access but must pay to do so. Adding magical power to an item with no effects is required at a minimum before effects can be placed on an item. As yout ry and weave more effects on top of another, the difficulty of creating the item increases and thus so does the price. The artificer accepts a mixture of Spire points and gold for enchantments. Each Magical Effect cost stacks onto the final item, but Enchantments as listed below have their own additional cost atop the Artificers service charge cost.
  
  |  Magical Effect  |       Cost      |
  |------------------|-----------------|
  |        +1        |  1 Point        |
  |        +2        |  2 Points       |
  |        +3        |  4 Points       |
  |   Enchantment    |  1 Point/100 gp |
  | 2nd Enchantment  |  2 Point/200 gp |



# Enchantments

  ## Banished
  
  Type: Weapon Enchantment
  
  Applicable: Any Weapon
  
  Cost: 200gp
  
  Description:
    This weapon is tied to a pocket dimension hidden on another plane and can be recalled as a Bonus Action to appear in your hand, or sent away as a free action while it dissipates into shadows and disappears from your hands.
    When freshly reclaimed, the next attack with this weapon has +1 to attack and Damage rolls.
    To reclaim a banished weapon, a small portal of shadows, no larger than 2 feet in diameter opens inches away from your open palmed hand for you to reach in and claim it. The portal only allows for the bounded object to be placed inside of it. (Can’t have a hollow hammer enchanted with this to store things inside it.) A Banished weapon cannot be sent away and summoned within the same round.
    
    
  ## Chill
  
  Type: Weapon Enchantment
  
  Applicable: Any Weapon
  
  Cost: 200gp
  
  Description:
      This weapon is imbued with the power to chill itself to temperatures so low they could almost cause frostbite.
      The weapon stores 4 charges of this ability at a time, and requires 1 hour to recover 1 charge.
      When a charge is activated, the next successful attack performed with this weapon does an extra 1d8 cold damage, and an extra +2 cold damage for each time they are struck with this ability within 5 minutes. If an enemy is hit by 3 charges, they must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 Character Level) or become frozen (immobilized) until the start of its next turn.
      Alternatively, 3 charges can be expelled to create magical glaciers occupying a 15' cube cast in front of the caster that lasts for 2 turns, ending on the casters turn. Those who start their turn in the glaciers take 1d8 cold damage, and are in difficult terrain. Entering the glaciers for the first time also causes 1d8 cold damage. Getting hit by the glacier adds one stack of Chill per time they take damage from the glacier. The glaciers magically evaporate away at the end of their time.
      Activating any amount of charges is a free action.

When using this effect, your weapon can reach an extra 5 feet but deals your Weapon Damage dice + Proficiency Bonus bludgeoning damage. As a constantly moving torrent, the water retreats back into the weapon at the end of your turn.
      As a bonus action, you can boil or chill the water to alter the damage caused by the water whip to become fire or cold damage for one hour. This cannot be changed again until after a chosen damage type has been in effect for the hour.

      In an instant, this armor collects grit and dirt to harden and bolster itself.
      2 times per day as a bonus action, you can add a layer of stone to the outer layer of your armor and increase your AC by 2. While the armor is in this state however, you have more limited movement and are heavier so you have 5' less movement speed and a -1 to Dexterity Saving Throws and Skill Checks. This stone layer only lasts for 30 seconds and then it loses the strength to sustain itself
      If a creature damages you with a melee weapon attack while your armor is petrified, as a reaction, you can choose to expel the stone outwards towards the attacking creature up to 5'. The targeted creature must succeed on a Dexterity Saving Throw of DC 14+Proficiency Bonus or take 3d8 bludgeoning damage. On a save they take half damage.

      Armor enchanted with this becomes sharpened at the corners with mithril spikes.
      When a melee attack within 5’ misses its intended target, Spikes from your armor leech out to stab the attacker. You can use your reaction to make an attack roll with half your AC added to your attack modifier. On a hit, it deals 1d4+1 piercing damage for light armor, and 1d8+1 for medium armor. Creatures hit with these spikes have disadvantage on attack rolls until they spend a full action removing the spikes from themselves.
      This can be used once per 2 character lvls per day.

      While wielding a shield with this enchantment, you can attempt to send back a portion of a ranged spell attack cast against you.
      When you are the target of a ranged spell attack and it doesn’t break your AC, you can use your reaction to roll a DC 12+Spell level Constitution Check to try and send half the damage you would have received back to the caster.
      The attack roll they made against you is what is used to determine if it breaks their AC or not.
      This effect does not work for AOE magic attacks.

      If you are wearing Sealing armor, you can command it with a reaction and a command word to close up fully in a cocoon shaped perfectly to the wearer.
      When this happens, all crevices and joints fuse together and lock up to provide a seal to the outside, encasing the wearer.
      The cocoon can be moved around but must be checked against a Strength check with DC of the wearers total weight/10.
      While the armor is sealed, the wearer is incapable of taking any actions or moving at all, cannot perceive outside the armor without magic, but can freely talk within the armor.
      While sealed, attack rolls against the wearer have advantage and the the wearer also automatically fails any strength or dexterity saving throws.
      So long as the armor is sealed, the wearer has a +5 to AC and has DR 1d12 against all damage. If the attack hit an area for damage, the wearer has resistance to that damage instead.
      It is a standard action to unseal the armor.

      Always damp to the touch, this armor calls bodies of water its' home.
      When this armor is exposed to a single body of water of at least a 5' cube of worth, it grants the wearer Fire resistance, advantage on Dexterity saving throws, the ability to breathe underwater, darkvision up to 30', and a swim speed of 25' for 1 minute so long as they remain touching the body of water.
      While wearing this armor, as a standard action you can loose a 5' cube worth of water that collects into a sphere at your location 2 times per long rest. When you create this water, it retains the shape of a sphere and is centered on the armor for up to 5 minutes, or earlier if you choose to dispel it. You can still walk while within this sphere, but your movement speed is reduced by 10'. So long as you are within this sphere, any damage taken from non-magical ranged attacks is reduced by 2. When dispelled, the sphere of water falls to the ground at your location; creatures within 5' of the water being let loose must succeed on a Strength saving throw of DC 13 or take 1d6 bludgeoning damage and be pushed back 5'.
      While touching enough water to contain your body, you meld yourself and all the Equipment you carry with you into the water for up to 8 hours. Using your Movement, you step into the water at a point you can touch. Nothing of your presence remains visible or otherwise detectable by non-magical Senses.
      While submerged with the water, you can't see what occurs outside it, and any Wisdom (Perception) checks you make to hear sounds outside it are made with disadvantage. You remain aware of the passage of time and can cast Spells on yourself while merged in the water. You can use your Movement to leave the water where you entered it, which ends the spell. You otherwise can't move.
      Minor physical alteration to the water doesn't harm you, but its partial removal or a change in its shape or state (to the extent that you no longer fit within it as water) expels you and deals 3d6 bludgeoning damage to you. The water's complete destruction (or Transmutation into a different substance) expels you and deals 20 bludgeoning damage to you. If expelled, you fall prone in an unoccupied space closest to where you first entered.
