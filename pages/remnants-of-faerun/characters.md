## Atresa

![Atresa](/assets/Atresa.jpg)

A member of the Red Rings, or "CC" (Crimson Crew). Default Friendship DC 18

Atresa was Born to the Hulika family of Hillsfar, a wealthy family who for 3 generations has Baron or Baroness control the estate and hold the title. They served Hillsfar as the high judge for their courts. She was brought up on home schooling alongside her younger brother and was being groomed to take over her fathers position one day. Her mother was against this however, and wished for her to pursue her own interests. In her free time, Atresa would tinker with machines, a hobby that started when she met a gnome in a court case one day and he was fixing a time piece while waiting in her fathers office. Ever since she has constructed gadgets for automatic water transference from a kettle to a cup, a system to close her bedroom door from her bed, and a system to create a vacuum in a lantern when placed on a specific vessel holder that unfortunately only worked for the one lantern she made specifically to fit it.

On Final examination day, you saw that Atresa chose for her homemade dagger launcher and her crystal to link and be infused with spells. Any dagger blade (minus the pommel and handle) she loads into her launcher becomes linked to her emerald. Four times per day, she can (use a standard action to) use Alarm, Silent Image, or Sleep (at first level) and cast them from her most recently fired dagger. Alternatively, she can sacrifice two uses to teleport either herself to her dagger, or she can force a creature struck by the dagger to make a Wisdom Saving Throw of DC 15 or be teleported 20' in any direction of Atresa's choice. Only one dagger can be employed at a time and be able to have spells cast from them. The most recent one is the dagger in use. Daggers must be within 200' to have spells cast from it.

## Favextra

![Favextra](/assets/Favextra.jpg)

A member of the Red Rings, or "CC" (Crimson Crew). Default Friendship DC 20

Favextra lived in the forest city of Spruceton most his life. He never stuck to any certain job or path, he usually let his heart guide him on what to do and where to go, but he always returned home to Spruceton.One day he had an unfortunate run-in with a trickster of the fey who had been in a foul mood before their meeting. His voice was stolen from him, and the fey left feeling better for having caused misery. Through his struggles, he has developed an unmatched affinity to communicate with and understand animals, to which he feels closer to than people now.

On Final examination day, you saw that Favextra chose to have his cloak become enchanted to pair with his animal companion. Whenever his pet owl rests on his cowl attached to his cloak, he gains the ability to levitate off the ground 10' for 1 hour at a time. Afterwards it needs 8 hours to recharge.

## Cesilia

![Cesilia](/assets/Cesilia.jpg)

A member of the Red Rings, or "CC" (Crimson Crew). Default Friendship DC 17

Cesilia grew up in middle class conditions and sought to gain the attention of her always busy father, who was a captain for the military. She realized one day that she could be a peace officer and be int he same line of work as him and perhaps gain approval that way. When she first applied she was turned down for the position for not being strong enough physically. She thus trained herself hard for a full year and when she returned she was able to best all competitors in all fields. She even won the inner-held contest amongst the potential recruits for hand to hand combat and grappled the instructor of the course into submission in 12 seconds. She was as happy as can be, but only retained her position for 2 weeks because she never brought in an arrest because "They said they wouldn't do it again" or "They seemed very regretful about the whole thing".

On Final examination day, you saw that Cesilia chose to have her armor become enchanted with amazing strength and protection. For 1 hour each day with it equipped, she can lift 2 times more than her normal, (adds +2 damage to all melee attacks) and is immune to being moved physically against her will (though she can still be lifted by magic or fall against her will). Additionally, she has advantage on grapple attempts and while successfully grappling a foe, they are considered Restrained instead of Grappled. Her armor also is weightless, acting as if she wasn't wearing armor at all for her mobility and unarmored defense purposes.

## Bristel

![Bristel](/assets/Bristel.jpg)

A member of the Red Rings, or "CC" (Crimson Crew). Default Friendship DC 21

She once worked as a scribe and chronicler for a judge, where she met her lover. One day she discovered that he was already married and confronted him about this. He apologized profusely and said he will remedy this situation swiftly because she was right, it was wrong to leave things how it was. heartbroken and betrayed, she went to part ways with him but was grabbed once her back was turned and a dagger slid across her throat. She heard her assailant say, "there, situation resolved. We had a good thing while it lasted." She was found and saved by a Marshal seeking records. Once she was well enough she planned an ambush and arranged to have a her former lover and his wife meet in a secluded space where he thought he was meeting a new lady friend he had been pursueing, and the wife following a note of instructions to show her that her husband was not the man she thought. When the confronted, an argument broke out about why he was in this place at this time when he had said he had to work late, and eventually he shoved her to the ground. At this time, Bristel struck, hitting him on his head with the pommel of a sword. He fell over in a daze and she walked over to him and cut out his tongue. She then pulled out a piece of metal she had been working on and heated it up on a candle nearby. she then branded him above his ear with the mark of a swindler.

On Final examination day, you saw that Bristel chose to make her favorite twin shortswords be able to channel wind. With this, she was able to use (a bonus action to make) her swords in a double swing to increase the movement speed of herself or an ally b 5' for 1 minutes with a Gale Wind. Additionally, she was able to inflict (4d4 slashing) damage to targets 15' away (twice per day as a standard action). After, she was able to produce harmless breezes at will up to 10' away. But the strange thing was that with every swing, her sword was silent.

## Irandrog

![Irandrog](/assets/Irandrog.jpg)

A member of the Red Rings, or "CC" (Crimson Crew). Default Friendship DC 20

Irindrog was born an Iron Dragon born, a rare mutation from a Copper and another Dragon born of different type. As such, his breath weapon sparks with lightning and his scales have a matte shine quality to them. He was bullied when he was young, and his mother shamed and accused of mating with a chromatic Dragon born. No amount of talk would quell these rumors, and so he came to despise society. Through a cruel twist of fate, his mother fell ill and passed away. Alone completely now, Irindrog decided his home had nothing to offer anymore and he set off to explore the world and see if there was anything worth living life for. He traveled with merchants, worked in inns, and eventually took up protection details. He met another dragon born, a silver named Deduron, during this journey. He was blind in one eye, more than likely the scar across it gave reason to why, and while in his company Irindrog found himself enthralled and begging for more tales from Deduron's world experience. Enamored by his youthful interest, Deduron would chuckle and oblige, all the while turning the stories into life lessons. When they needed to deal with some bandits once, Irindrog missed most of his shots to his embarrassment but the group was successful overall in deterring them. Deduron started giving him tips and lessons on how to improve himself and Irindrog absorbed every bit of training he was willing to offer. It wasn't long til they both realized he had a knack for archery. Soon he almost matched Deduron. At the end of their 2 month journey together, Irindrog begged to further accompany Deduron, but was turned down. Deduron explained following him in life will not provide what he needs in this part of his life. He recommended he learn more of the world, and if he could discover the reason the world is so young, when there's evidence they are not the first to walk and rule it, then he would love to reunite and hear all about it.

On Final examination day, you saw that Irindrog chose to have his bow enchanted to charge arrows fired from it to trigger a small electrical burst if lightning is cast within 5' of them. Targets struck by one of these arrows have a static charge stored onto them up to 3. If a target with a static charge is damaged by lightning damage, the static charge adds an additional 3 lightning damage, or 4 lightning if the target is wearing full metal armor or is made of metal. Stored static lasts for 1 minute and the bow can hold a number of charges equal to your proficiency bonus+1 and recharges 1 charge every minute.

## Greylin

![Greylin](/assets/Greylin.jpg)

A member of the Red Rings, or "CC" (Crimson Crew). Default Friendship DC 17

Born in the city of Hillsfar, his family never really had it made. For 3 generations, they worked a stall in the local market selling a variety of meat from hunting in the nearby forest. Until 3 years ago, Greylin and his brother and sister helped work the stall or hunt because their mother fell ill and their father took care of her. Things weren't looking good though when the sheriff imposed a higher tax on the street of stalls where theirs resided. He claimed it a liability protection fee because they were the second closest market to the front gates and therefor a target for thieves. No matter how much the fellow vendors complained, they fell on deaf ears. The new trouble caused some fighting when they returned that night, the siblings having a yelling match over what to do. Their father said things will work themselves off, they'll just have to work harder and that they have to be a unit, not fight with themselves. Unsatisfied, Greylin went at night to try and convince the sheriff to reconsider. At the front gates he was denied an audience and began to cause a ruckus, to the point where they threw him out. licking his wounds on his way back home, he was stopped by a bag of money with a note. it read, "Share with your fellow vendors, you will survive this blights of taxes yet". Returning home he shared what happened to his family and was mixed with a mixed reaction of satisfaction and disdain to the charity. His dad argued that it is probably dishonest money and they should turn it over, and his brother agreed they would get in unrecoverable trouble if they are founds with it. His sister agreed with him however that this is about survival and that plenty other families just like theirs was having it hard already without the new tax. Ultimately Greylins mom weighed in saying it was entrusted to Greylin, he should decide. With that Greylin made the rounds distributing money to each stall and letting them know to stay silent on the fact they were helped. A few weeks passed afterwards and they were able to survive the first round of collections without having to change much. But Greylin was bothered the whole time on who was it that helped them and why. He wanted to be that person, the one to help others when they couldn't help themselves.

On Final examination day, you saw that Greylin chose for his shoulder plate to become enchanted with a recharging teleportation spell. Any 3 items at a time that he leaves within it for 1 hour that fits within it (can't be taller than it) becomes attuned to the plate. He used a gold piece as an example, and tossed it across the room. He then asked for someone to strike at him and then (used a reaction) and teleported to where the coin was (and could make a standard melee attack at the new location).
