### Teyluu

#### Background:
Almost 1400 years ago the world known as Faerun was rewritten. The land masses changed by the power of gods, and the established cities of power and splendor were casualties of great conflict. The hubris of the Kings and Queens of Faerun bred ill-content and condemnation from various pockets in the world, til groups clashed and sought powers the knew not how to control. Deities, never meant to share our plane, were summoned and used as tools of determent and rights of rule. 
Raegiir, King of Amn, replacement of the Council of Six, gained support from Lord Ao, the Being of Light. 
Ralan Pesarkhal, King of Calimshan won the favor of Grumbar, the God of Elemental Earth and Oaths, and etugen, Grumbars aspect who was regarded as goddess of earth, pastures, and herds. 
Yaevet, Queen of Chessenta, was guided by Lathander, the God of Spring, youth, birth, and vitality. 
Strenton, King of Chondath, formed alliances with Waukeen, Goddess of Trade, and Malar, the God of the Hunt. 
And lastly Queen Xiadorma of Damara won over Talos, God of Storms, and Tempus, God of War and warriors.

Soon, all the Monarchs had at least one God or Goddess on their side, as they eyed one another on who would make the first move. But an outside group, known only as The Memorum, unleashed three gods unto the world. Bane, the Black Lord, God of hatred, fear, and Tyranny. Cyric, God of Murder, Lies, and Deception. and Lolth, Goddess of Drowm Spiders, Chaos and Evil. Together, they caused destruction, havoc and reaping fear amongst the Monarchs. They started fighting each other, thinking their rivals had finally started the battle. Towns were devastated, armies became irrelevant. Only champions so bold, and the deities and their blessings mattered now. After a month of war, the Monarchs wanted a truce and to rebuild as one kingdom, as none were in a condition to survive anymore. When the accord was to be made however, The Memorum struck, unleashing the three Deities aligned with their cause again in a coordinated attack. All the Monarchs were slain, their pacts broken with their Deities, who then retreated to their respective Planes. And the Memorum were never seen again. For another year the world would continue to be a dangerous place. Seas rising, Mountains crumbling and Volcanoes releasing their fury. By the time the world was calming, three cities of notoriety rose. Umbra in the new continent of Calimsar, Presido, in the old land of Amn, and Gassiron in Damara. As time would march forward, so would the cycle repeat itself. Cities expanded and boundaries were drawn. But the largest a war would progress in 1000 years would be 3 battles long with 600 casualties. Each year that progressed promised for the past to be forgotten more and more. Outside city walls or cleared areas the world remained dangerous however. Ancient magic lingers in the world, and nobody knows all of what is out there.

### The Spire

#### Background:
The Spire is a school for learning magic and martial skills to better be suited to serving the people or improving the practices. It is very exclusive for entering, as it requires the approval of both headmasters who seek talent, potential, and intrigue. It is a tall tower for its main building, with a large yard outside of it called the Court, and a centered circular area outside the front of The Spire floored with tan bricks called the Yard. Its front gate connects to the main road of Bridgetown, a business center that revels in being connected to the Spire, as they provide services to The Spire in exchange for assistance with personal requests from the students. All of this rests above a bay of ocean on a column of rock connected only by the arch of Bridgetown. There are more columns with smaller buildings that connects to the Spire, but this houses residential and recreational buildings for students and visitors. The Spire consists of where classes are held. It is an 7 story tall spire, and the column it rests on is 300 ft above water level.

#### Hierarchy:
Hierarchy of the residents rank in order of Fletchling, Sparrow, Hawk, Eagle, Headmaster.

* Fletchling is a new tryout who must pass their final evaluation after 3 years study or be asked to leave the university and return to retry in a year, but only needing to repeat the last year they did instead of all 3.

* Sparrows have passed their exams and are considered full student and or graduates of The Spire. Them and any level above them are considered graduates of The Spire. They are recognized by their Bronze rings on their right Ring finger.

* Hawks are like professors, they oversee the continued education and or training of Sparrows. They have a minimum of 5 years field experience and have been recognized by the Headmasters by recommendation from an Eagle. They are recognized by Silver rings on their right Middle finger.

* Eagles are heads of departments within The Spire. The choose which requests to accept from civilians, budgeting of various sorts for the school at large, and have been recognized and promoted to their positions by the Headmaster's themselves. They adorn Gold Rings on their right Index finger.

* Headmasters are the top of the food-chain of the school. They have final say on any matter they see the need to weigh in on and spend their days observing students and counseling with Hawks and Eagles on curriculum. The are the public speakers for The Spire when needs arise, and handle their unique political placement of a land within Presidio but outside the reach of Queen Hauvreigha. They wear one of each ring along with a Black ring that is on their thumb. Ido wears his on his left, and Iro on his right.

There are other staff as well, who work at the spire outside any sort of academic purpose. A quartermaster, a cleric, a clerk, 2 cooks, 3 groundskeepers, a librarian, and a harbormaster. Each of these people hire off and on as the season demands of course. sometimes students, sometimes from Bridgetown, and sometimes as a favor to somebody coming to seek experience from them and they were able to convince them to be given a shot. Additionally at times new faces can be seen for a month or 2 at a time assisting the headmasters as errand runners but they never stay on school grounds.

There are plenty of laws for grounds of The Spire, but some are unique to get you expelled. 
Of course there are normal laws of not killing or stealing, but those are more laws of the land that are just upheld.

#### For The Spire exclusively:

* You cannot interfere with the studies of another student purposefully

* You cannot trespass within The Spire past Sunset without a Hawk or highers approval and supervision

* The Undergrounds are strictly forbidden

* You cannot harm or blemish the school grounds or its foundation(Expulsion from this requires large damage)

* You cannot tamper or touch any constructs, installations, or non-student related systems that The Spire has around its campus.

* You may not bring great shame or dishonor to the name of The Spire through your representation to others outside the school to a point the Headmasters must get involved.

* Weapons and Magic are not to be brandished outside of The Spire on school grounds beyond carrying to and from the residential's to The Spire or assisting with official school business as directed by a Hawk or higher.

* Materials and property of The Spire is not to leave The Spire without properly checking it out with the Clerk first.

### Studies:
When your character dedicates time to studies, they may choose a subject on the skills in your character sheet or of a specialty subject by the classes offered from the school. One academic and one physical skill can be trained or studied at a time. Each segment of time you study earns a point towards that skill or subject. You can only study one physical and one academic subject per day. At 5 points, you can attempt a d20 roll, and on a 18-20, you gain a permanent +1 misc. bonus to that skill.  Studies cannot take place during a long rest where you are recovering hit points or spell slots. While at The Spire, studies take place in the library using their resources, which never depleet. When outside The Spire, you require books to study. Books last for 5 instances of studying for whatever subject it is in.

All students have a class that they naturally excelled in during their fletchling days, and carries on into their time as a Sparrow. If you gain a +2 misc. bonus to another specialty subject then you gain proficiency in that subject as well.

### Tests:
At the end of a month, (30 days), students have a test held at The Spire to measure the performance of each of your skills. You will attempt a roll with each skill, and your collective results determine your grades. However, you must also get at least passing with more than half of your skills (10 of them). If you are proficient in a specialty subject, you gain an additional roll per specialty subject that will replace your lowest roll(s).

|   DC  | Grade |
|-------|-------|
| <7    | F     |
| 7-10  | D     |
| 11-14 | C     |
| 15-19 | B     |
| >19   | A     |

Your monthly grades determine if you gain any points to spend around for school services and perhaps even a discount on your tuition.

All of your grades are tallied up into an average which determines your outcome.

| Grade | Outcome                                       |
|-------|-----------------------------------------------|
| F     | Owe an extra 200 gold or 2 points for tuition |
| D     | Owe an extra 100 gold or 1 point for tuition  |
| C     | Nothing happens                               |
| B     | Gain 2 points                                 |
| A     | Gain 3 points                                 |

### Classmates:
By spending time with classmates, you can make them more willing to lend you a hand. Whenever you go on a mission that isn't delegated to you by your Hawks, you can ask classmates to come with you for assistance provided they are available. When you ask a classmate, you need to have at least spent some time with them outside of school for them to consider it. Hanging out once allows the option to roll a d20 and on a 20, they will assist you on your endeavor. Every 2 times you hang out with a person, you decrease the DC by 1. Standings with classmates is on a personal basis, but you can spend time together in groups. If they are not available your time is not wasted. 

### Artificer:
The artificer’s services are up for graduated students. Every new graduate is allowed a maximum of 2 items to be improved as a graduation gift. Any further improvements require points or gold. Each point is the equivalent of 100 gold when it comes to enchantments. Prices are normally rounded up for uneven amounts, but the Artificers have been known to allow a smidge of haggling.

### Quartermaster:
The Quartermaster can get his hands on anything and everything; "I just need the time", he claims. From weapons, armor, materials, and equipment, he will do all he can to find it. A special request from the quartermaster costs 1 point, provided he doesn’t already have what you seek. A special request would be for an item that is not found in the Player's Handbook. The item you request will still have a price associated with it in addition to the point paid to find such an item. Don't ask the impossible though, you need to give a lead on where he can find the item if he himself doesn't know where to begin looking. Because the Quartermaster likes to ramble any trip to him will take some time.

### Library:
The Library provides an excellent place to study and explore for information of the land. The Spire also has exclusive texts, requiring a fee in exchange for a chance to acquire some of their knowledge. For 1 point, a student may, with supervision, read and choose 1 exclusive text in the field of a skill. 1 point lasts for a month worth of access. An exclusive text takes 3 days to finish, or 2 if you have proficiency in the subject of linguistics. When you finish reading a text, your next Studies roll you perform to attempt for a Misc. bonus will have an increased range of 14-20 instead of the normal 18-20 until you succeed at a roll. You are only allowed to read 1 exclusive text fully per week.

You can also check out books from the Library, but they have a due date of 2 weeks. Books from the library are special in that they last for 10 instances of study instead of 5 like other books. Additionally, fully finishing a rented book grants an additional study point upon completion. You can only check out books when going on a mission assigned by The Spire to keep the texts out of unnecessary risk as much as possible. Overdue books acrue a late fee of 5 gold per day they are late. If you are unable to return the book by it being lost or destroyed, your tuition for the next month increases by 100 gold.

### Harbor:
Students now have the option to store vessels in the harbor at the cost of 1 point per month. Each student may only store 1 vessel at a time, and said vessel must fit within the dock's parameters (25’ across maximum). Additionally you can fish at the docks if you have a rod, bait, and tackle. While fishing at the docks you will have 3 chances to roll a d6 and guess your result. If within 1 of your guess, you catch a small fish that sells for 2 gold. If you match your guess, you get a big catch that sells for 5 gold. If you are an Outlander, Pirate, Sailor, or Swashbuckler, you gold yield for small fish increases by 1d4 and 1d6 for big catches.

### Sparring Grounds:
The Sparring Grounds is where one goes to train their more physical skills. Additionally, you can coordinate to have team spars with other classmates at this location. Wagers of points or gold can be made if you can convince your opponents to place a bet, provided you have such currency to wager. Points can only be exchanged between students with authority of an eagle to complete the transaction. Spars are only allowed once a week so all students stay healthy and fit for when their Hawks may assign them tasks.

Spars are done through a series of quick attacks where each contestant will roll attacks 3x. These spars are done with Spire provided equipment, weaponry and implements with the exception of spellbooks. Spars can only occur between two combatants that are using the same style of fighting, being melee or magical. Once the style is decided, contestants are permitted to use whatever is in their repetoire of that style for the attacks. Range and positioning are irrelevant in these instances and thus abilities requiring or granting bonuses for such conditions do not activate. Any attacks that would result in a condition being applied such as blindness or invisibility can still be utilized, however the effects of charmed, paralyzed, petrified, and stunned will always only last for 1 of the 3 attacks.

### Regular Job:
Lots of the citizens of Bridgetown depend on students as an occasional workforce. You can take jobs from them for the day and earn gold as a reward. You may roll a d20, with a DC of 20 minus the number of skills your are proficient in, to try and find yourself a job. [Ex: if you are proficient in 4 skills, your DC is 16]. If you find a job you are proficient in, you will earn 2+1d6 gold. You can only work in bridgetown twice in a week. If you are unsuccessful in finding a job, your time for that portion of the day is wasted.

### Shopping:
While the Quartermaster has lots of items needed by adventurers, the local merchants and traders in Bridgetown may have some specialty, novelty, or more frivolous items you may find yourself wanted from time to time. You can also look for books in Bridgetown, but it may be tough to find what you need. You will need to roll a d6 and on a 4-5, you find a book while on a 6 you find 2. The type of book you find will be based on a few rolls. You will start with a d20 roll and depending on what you roll, you will have the option to take the roll or go for a specialty subject book if that is an option. If you choose the specialty subject book, you will roll a d10, d6, or d4 depending on what you rolled, though some instances are just one to one trade off of skill book to specialty subject books.

### Gambling:
There are certain areas of Bridgetown that you can go to if you know the right people to get in on some games of chance. Attending these gambling houses requires a successful Sneak check of DC 15 to not be noticed entering. If you are proficient in disguise kits, you have advantage on this Sneak check. Once inside you can choose to partake in cards or dice. All gambling is a double or nothing wager with a minimum of 5 gold and a maximum of 20. All wagers are declared before games begin

In cards, you will be playing blackjack against the house and see who can get closest to 21 without going over. You will each roll 3 d10 and have 2 oppurtunities to reroll the current lowest number of your rolls. The player must choose their options of rerolls before the house rolls their initial dice. The house must stop once they hit 17 however. If you have proficiency in cards, you get 3 rerolls instead of 2.

In dice, you will be playing a game of craps. You will be playing as the shooter. As shooter, you will roll 2d6 and on a 7, or 11, you win. On a 2, 3, or 12, you lose. If you get a different number besides the aforementioned numbers, that becomes your target number. You will then keep rolling the dice until you get the target number again, in which case you win, or if you roll a 7, in which case you lose. If you have proficiency in dice, then you can choose a second additional number as a target number when rolling for the latter case.

### Culinary Indulgence:
Exotic food at the market is always abound with how popular a stop Bridgetown is for the Broken Sea. By scouring the markets and partaking in unique dishes, you can give your body the edge in your next encounter (The temporary hit points do not become effective until your next encounter or when you next take damage). For 1d10 gold pieces, you can spend time in the market and then roll a d20 if you want to spend that much. 0-3 the Food you find is good, but not beneficial healthwise. On a 4-10, you gain 1d4+1 temp HP. On an 11-15, you gain 1d6+1 temporary hit points. And on a 16-20, you gain 1d8+1 temporary hit points. While you can visit the market multiple times, boosts do not stack and the most recent successful visit dictates your temporary hit points. 

### Laboratory:
Students who are proficient in Biology or Herbology may use the laboratory to expend their ingredients in order to make potions or medicine. If you do not have the means or ingredients, services of the Lab may be purchased from the Laboratory as well. Supplies are often limited, so the Laboratory will sometimes send requests to The Spire in order to replenish their stock.

A typical potion will require 3-6 ingredients. Ingredients range from a rating of Common to Legendary with various potencies per level of rarity. When brewing a potion, you need an ingrediant that specializes as an effect, one as a synthesizer, and one as an enhancer. When you go to brew a potion, you will roll a Biology or Herbology skill check with the DC determined by the used ingredients to successfully brew the potion. Adding the potency score of all ingredients gives you the DC to try and brew the potion. The DC is reduced by 1 for every +1 misc. bonus you have to the specialty subject. Adding more than the minimum ingredients to a brew will change the effects of the potion. Adding extra effect ingredients will increase the bonus of the effect. Adding extra synthesizers will decrease the DC for a successful brew. And adding extra enhancer ingredients will grant an extra use of that potion, though sometimes you will need to add more than 1 synthesizer and/or enhancer for them to be strong enough to grant an extra use. A potion takes so long to brew and a student can only have 1 concoction brewing on the side when it is not for class at a time. Do not worry if you are not present when the potion is finished brewing, as it will be taken care of by staff.


|  Rarity    | Potency | Effect/(#)Resist  |  (#)Synthesizer | (#)Enhancer |
|------------|---------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------|
|  Common    |    1    |    +1d4/ (1) 1    |    (1) DC -1    | (1) 1 use   |
|  Uncommon  |    3    |    +1d6/ (2) 2    |    (2) DC -2    | (2) 2 uses  |
|  Rare      |    5    |    +1d8/ (1) 2    |    (1) DC -2    | (1) 2 uses  |
|  Very Rare |    7    |    +1d10/(2) 3    |    (2) DC -3    | (2) 3 uses  |
|  Legendary |    9    |    +2d8/ (1) 3    |    (1) DC -3    | (1) 3 uses  |

|  Potency  |   DC    | Days to Brew |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
|  3-8      |   13    |       2      |
|  9-12     |   15    |       3      |
|  13-18    |   17    |       4      |
|  19-24    |   19    |       5      |
|  25-30    |   21    |       6      |
|  31-45    |   23    |       7      |

### Crafts and Talents:
Students who have other worldy experience have oppurtunities to make a commercial name for themselves in Bridgetown. If you are proficient in certain tool kits, you can use that expertise to create crafts or provide services to others with the hope of a profit. You do need to lease a booth on Marketstreet for 10+1d10 gold (Fluctuating availability of spaces). Once you've leased a booth you will roll a d20 and get at least a DC 9 to break even. Each tool kit has a different degree of difficulty associated with it that determines how hard it is to turn a profit. This takes into account start-up costs of materials and or work done. Rolling a DC 10 - (listed DC) will net you your money back on the booth and the profit amount listed, but rolling above the listed DC will do the same but double your profit +1d6+1. To work the booth you must dedicate 2 time slots to it, where the first is prep, and the second is the sale. Only one set of rolls is done though.

### Good Night's Sleep:
Sometimes the best thing to do is have a nice light meal, a warm drink, and head to sleep for the night a bit early. Doing so the day before an adventure will net you +1 on initiative rolls and +1 against Wisdom saving throws for the first encounter of your next adventure. This benefit can only be gained from sleeping in your dorm bed.
