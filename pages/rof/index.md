## Background

The Spire is a school for learning magic and martial skills to better be suited to serving the people or improving the practices. It is very exclusive for entering, as it requires the approval of both headmasters who seek talent, potential, and intrigue. It is a tall tower for its main building, with a large yard outside of it called the Court, and a centered circular area outside the front of The Spire floored with tan bricks called the Yard. Its front gate connects to the main road of Bridgetown, a business center that revels in being connected to the Spire, as they provide services to The Spire in exchange for assistance with personal requests from the students. All of this rests above a bay of ocean on a column of rock connected only by the arch of Bridgetown. There are more columns with smaller buildings that connects to the Spire, but this houses residential and recreational buildings for students and visitors. The Spire consists of where classes are held. It is an 7 story tall spire, and the column it rests on is 300 ft above water level.

## Schedule

The school has a very consistant pattern to their days. 

Firstday through Ninthday there are classes in the morning and afternoon, taking up time of your day and limiting you to 3 acivity slots. Tenthday and holidays are days off, freeing you up for 4 activity slots. Exams are always held on the 30th of a month, and tuition is due the 1st of a month.

School is out of session for all of Flamerule, or Summertide, and tution does not need to be paid. During this time, only the dorms and meals are available officially, arrangements can be made to meet with staff if needed. And Classes are not held for the last week of the month in Nightal, or The Drawing Down, but the campus is still open.

If it is a graduation year, The ceremony is held on the first tenthday of Mirtul, or The Melting. Graduates however immediently return to classes of their new Hierarchy until classes are let out in Flamerule so Hawks and Eagles may evaluate a months worth of their efforts and progress for consideration to keep on as their new level.


## Hierarchy

Hierarchy of the residents rank in order of Fletchling, Sparrow, Hawk, Eagle, Headmaster.

* Fletchling is a new tryout student who must pass their final evaluation after 3 years study or be asked to leave the university and return to retry in 3 years, but only needing to repeat the last year they did instead of all 3. Only 30 students are accepted at a time.

* Sparrows have passed their exams and are considered full student and or graduates of The Spire. on that note, they and any level above them are considered graduates of The Spire even if they do not continue their education past this level. They are recognized by their Bronze rings on their right Ring finger. They continue similar, but more advanced studies of their Fletchling days for as long as they seek. After 3 years, they become elligible to be nominated for a rank up by a Hawk and with a Headmasters approval.

* Hawks are like professors, they oversee the continued education and or training of Fletchlings and Sparrows. They have a minimum of 3 years field experience and have been recognized by the Headmasters by recommendation from a Hawk. They choose which requests to accept from citizens asking The Spire for help. They are recognized by Silver rings on their right Middle finger.

* Eagles are heads of departments within The Spire. They choose which requests to accept from cities and kingdoms, budgeting of various sorts for the school at large, and have been recognized and promoted to their positions by the Headmaster's themselves. They give guidance and direction to Hawks under their department and are a first line of administration below the Headmasters. They adorn Gold Rings on their right Index finger.

* Headmasters are the top of the food-chain of the school. They have final say on any matter they see the need to weigh in on and spend their days observing students and counseling with Hawks and Eagles on curriculum. The are the public speakers for The Spire when needs arise, and handle their unique political placement of a land within Presidio but outside the reach of Queen Hauvreigha. They wear one of each ring along with a Black ring that is on their thumb. Ido wears his on his left, and Iro on his right.

There are other staff as well, who work at the spire outside any sort of academic purpose. A quartermaster, an infirmary dedicated cleric, a clerk, cooks, groundskeepers, a Master librarian, and a harbourmaster. Each of these people hire off and on from regular people as the season demands of course. Sometimes students, sometimes from Bridgetown, and sometimes as a favor to somebody coming to seek experience from them and they were able to convince them to be given a shot. Additionally at times new faces can be seen for a month or 2 at a time assisting the headmasters as errand runners but they never stay on school grounds.

There are plenty of laws for grounds of The Spire, but some are unique to get you expelled. 
Of course there are normal laws of not killing or stealing, but those are more laws of the land that are just upheld.

## Tests:

At the end of a month, (30 days), students have a test held at The Spire to measure the performance of each of your skills. You will attempt a roll with each skill, and your collective results determine your grades. However, you must also get at least passing with more than half of your skills (10 of them). If you are proficient in a specialty subject, you gain an additional roll per specialty subject that will replace your lowest roll(s).

|   DC  | Grade |
|-------|-------|
| <7    | F     |
| 7-10  | D     |
| 11-14 | C     |
| 15-19 | B     |
| >19   | A     |

Your monthly grades determine if you gain any points to spend around for school services and perhaps even a discount on your tuition.

All of your grades are tallied up into an average which determines your outcome.
