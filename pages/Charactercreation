# Remnants of Faerun: Homebrew Subclasses
Since the dawn of the new world, built on the ruins of faerun, new creatures, magic, and feats from indivuals are discovered every day. These individuals carve their name into the tomes of history through their new achievements or ability and strength.

## Barbarian
The people called savages or brutes by the everyday person ignore their scoffs and looks of distain, for they know that the fits of aggression they fear, are the boons of nature. And what is nature, but chaos. These Primal Paths represent the newfound power that some indiviuals have found themselves able to access.

### Path of the Savage Beast
Born in nature, you were raised by and learned from its creatures. Their example leads to your survival, their power an inspiration. After a while you unlocked the potential within yourself to embody them in aspects beyond normal capabilities. Their spirit fills you and grants you their abilities and strength. You lead your life with the instincts and prowess of the beast, making you more dangerous than others could comprehend.

#### Feral Origins
At 3rd level, you choose a Primal Beast that speaks to you inner animal from the Primal Beast table. You gain Beast Claws (2d4+1 damage) to replace your unarmed strikes. The nature of your beast claws depends on your Primal Beast. For any saving throws creatures have to make against your Primal Beast abilities, use (DC 8 + your Strength modifier + your proficiency bonus). So long as you have a free hand, you can use your bonus action to make an attack with your Beast Claws. These Beast Claws are usable while in Rage.

At 5th level, your Beast Claws increase to 3d4+1 damage. At 10th level, your Beast Claws increase to 4d4+1 damage.

At 3rd level, when you adopt this path, you gain the following benefits when in the home terrain of your beast.

While raging, as a bonus action, you can unleash a roar that induces fear. All hostile creatures within a 30 foot radius must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a fail, they become frightened. They can reattempt their saving throw at the end of each of their turns. Once a creature saves, they are immune to this roar for 1 hour. You can use this ability once per long rage.

Additionally, your Beast Claws now count as magical for the sake of overcoming resistances and immunities.

### Transformation
At 10th level, You can expend additional charges of Rage as an action to assume a rage form that polymorphs you into a were-creature or half-creature of your Primal Beast.
For each charge of Rage you expend beyond 1, you transform your body. You remain changed for 1 minute per charge and gain 5 temporary hit points per charge. This transformation does not affect your alignment.

Using the Beast stat block from the Monster Manual, if any of your ability scores would increase, apply the changes for the duration. If they would decrease, use your original scores instead. This does not affect your hit points, AC, or actions beyond what is granted. While in this form of rage, you disarm yourself at the time of transformation and only can use Beast Claws to attack. you also gain the ability listed in the Transformation Tier 1 Table.

### Path of the Blood Seeker
Red. In the heat of battle, the color red is sometimes your world. As more and more death occurs around you, you remember less and less of the time; but you always remember red.  The blood on you that you awaken to fills you with a zealous feeling. It is indescribable, yet comforting. This is the feeling you chase when you go into battle. The exhilaration is worth death, especially the death of someone who would stand in your way.

#### Bloodshed
Beginning at 3rd level, your attacks and vitality increase in brutality as you smell and feel blood. While raging and not wearing Medium or Heavy armor, you gain a point of bloodshed up to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1) whenever you reduce an enemy to 0 it points, score a critical hit, or are reduced to half health (can only occur once every hour). You gain +1 to your AC per stack of bloodshed up to a maximum of +3. When your rage ends, you lose all stacks of Bloodshed.
	While raging, after you roll damage for a successful melee attack roll, you can spend a point of Bloodshed to reroll any amount of the die you rolled for the attack. If any of the new rolls are the maximum amount of damage for that die, you add your Constitution modifier to the total damage per instance of maximum amount rolled.

#### Consumption
Starting at 6th level, your enemies pain becomes your sustenance.

After you successfully hit with a melee attack roll, you can spend a point of bloodshed before rolling damage to heal for the amount of damage done with that attack. If this attack kills the creature, you gain additional hit points equal to your Constitution modifier + Barbarian level.

#### Bloodthirsty
Starting at 10th level, Your adrenaline from pain and anger gives you a second burst of strength at the cost of your foes.

If you are reduced to half your maximum hit point total, you get a free use of Consumption on your next turn without using a point of Bloodshed. If you do not use this free use of Consumption by the end of your next turn, it is lost.


Additionally, you gain the following feature while under half of your maximum hit point total. If you heal to above half of your hit point maximum, you lose these features. You can only gain these features once per Encounter.

If you spend a point of Bloodshed, gain the following attribute until the end of your turn.

* Gain 1d8 bonus damage of the damage type that was used in the attack.
* Your critical hit threshold is increased to 19-20.
* If you reduce a creature to 0 hit points while an ally is within 5 feet of you and the creature, you and your ally gain 1d6 temporary hit points.

#### Bloodbath
Starting at 14th level, you have eyes only for seeking more blood, with no regard for it's owner. 

Whenever you spend a point of Bloodshed while benefiting from Bloodthirsty, as a bonus action, you move up to 40 feet (regardless of current remaining movement speed) and must use the movement to go towards the closest creature to you, even allies. You do not provoke attacks of opportunity for this movement. As you come into range of a creature to make an attack roll, do so with advantage and then move on to the next closest creature that you have yet to attack with any remaining movement. If multiple targets are the same distance away, choose randomly on who to attack. If any of these attacks kill a creature, you gain another 15 feet of movement and a +1 to all future attack rolls for this usage of the ability to a maximum of +5.
You cannot use this ability if your speed is currently 0. This ability can only be used once per rage.


&nbsp;

### Earth Shaker

Legends all over the world have their own reasons for how the mountains were made. Dwarves carving out the land, Gods summoning plateaus for their temples, myths abound with the storytelling awe and wonder for a child. But for a select few of extraordinary power, the ground truly does bend for them. With the rage and strength rumored to belong to the gods, the land beneath their feet heads their will.

#### Tremor Strength
Beginning at 3rd level, your attacks echo out a small tremor from your blows.

As a bonus action, you can add this affect to your next attack roll. All creatures within 5 feet of your target must make a Constitution saving throw equal to 10 + Rage Damage or have their speed reduced by 5 feet and suffer a -1 to any attack rolls made until the end of your next turn. On a save, nothing happens. Once a creature makes this save, they are immune to further effects of this effect for 1 hour.

While raging, your Strength score increases by 1, and can exceed the normal limit of 20. This increases to a bonus of 2 at 12th level.

#### Grounded Impact
Starting at 6th level, you can double down on your own defense while throwing away foes nearby.

As an action, you can perform a Strength check (DC 14 - your Strength modifier) . On a success, You slam the ground and knock up large chunks of debris at all creatures within 5 feet as it scatters around you. All creatures within the area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6+1 bludgeoning damage, are moved 5 feet away from you and knocked prone. On a success, they take half damage, are moved 5 feet away from you, but are not knocked prone.

The surrounding affected area is now difficult terrain for all creatures except you, and provides half cover for any creature in the center of the area.

You can perform this move once per rage.
If you throw a chunk of debris created by this ability as an improvised ranged attack, you have proficiency for the attack and it deals 1d6 + Strength modifier for damage.

```
```

#### Body of the Earth
Starting at 10th level, your body gains a rocklike quality while raging.

You gain the feature, Immutable Form: You are immune to any spell or effect that would alter your form. Additionally, you become immune to petrification.
If you use Grounded Impact, your AC increases by 1 until the end of your next turn.

#### Mountain’s Rage
Starting at 14th level, the mountains call and sing for you and your fury.

As an action, you can perform a Strength check  (DC 17 - Strength modifier) to punch stone, dirt, or sand beneath you. On a success, you punch into the ground below you and summon a 30 foot tall, 15’ square pillar of earth beneath a point you can see within 30 feet. All creatures within the area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 12 + Rage Damage) or they are struck by the pillar and take 2d12 bludgeoning damage. If the pillar collides with a ceiling, the creature takes an additional 2d6 bludgeoning damage and is restrained. A restrained creature can reattempt it’s Dexterity saving throw at the start of each of its turns to end their restrained condition. If the creature's speed is reduced in any way when it is targeted by this ability, they have disadvantage on their saving throw to avoide the pillar. On a save, the creature move to the nearest unoccupied location.

Because you created this pillar, you know it’s weak point, and can perform a melee attack on it to make it crumble into a 15’ tall pile of rubble that provides 3/4's cover and acts as difficult terrain.

## Bard
So many tradesman stick to the safe and tried paths of talents and knowledge. Seeking stories and wooeing crowds with their charm and looks, the line between a bard and a conman is becoming more blurred with the passing of time. But some seek to earn their titles with the grandest of peformances, or the most honest of jests. To these practitioners of the arts, the stage is where the heart can come alive.

### Circus Performer
Raised in troupes and by carnies and minstrels, you embellish in the art of performing. The stories of plays, and tales from song light the fire behind your eyes hotter than fire you perform with. Through the years you have gained many talents and tricks, shadowing performers as they came and went with shows. Now you embark to create your own tricks, your own name, and maybe one day have people know you by your show.

#### Animal Performers
Starting at 3rd level, you become proficient in Performance and Animal Handling. You also gain the ability to summon 1 animal for your acts at a given time, or for your personal protection as if casting Conjure Animals but ignoring the challenge rating limit and how many are summoned. As an action, you can use a Bardic Inspiration point to summon one of the listed animals from a portal you create to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. Summoned creatures have their own initiative and obey all verbal commands you issue. If you give no commands, the creature will protect itself to the best of its ability. Your summoned animal starts with a Bardic Inspiration die. As you gain more levels in Bard, you can summon more exotic animals, provided you have the performance skill to handle them. If the summoned animal hits 0 hit points, it is instantly sucked back into a portal that opens underneath it and cannot be re-summoned for 24 hours. You can dismiss a summoned animal with an action back into a portal.



#### Animal Performers
| Bard Level | Min. Performance skill bonus | Summoned Animal |
|-------|---------|-----------|
|3rd|6|Flying Monkey or Dolphin|
|6th|9|Black Bear or Sea Lion|
|10th|12|Brown Bear or Shark|
|14th|15|Tiger or Giant Octopus|
|18th|16|Elephant or Killer Whale|

#### Crack of the Whip
Starting at 3rd level, you become proficient with Whips, and any damage made by a whip you wield counts as magical damage.

You can use the Fighter’s Disarming Attack maneuver with a whip by using a Bardic Inspiration die instead of a Superiority die. The Strength save for this maneuver is (DC 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your proficiency bonus), and upon a success you can choose to force the target to drop the item at their feet or you can pull it back to you and it drops at your feet. 

Additionally, If you have an Animal Performer out, you can use a bonus action to crack the whip and grant the Animal Performer a free attack on your turn with advantage, and 10 feet of additional movement speed on their next turn.

#### Ringmaster
Starting at 6th level, As an action you can use a bardic inspiration die to summon a ring with burning edges 5 feet in front of you. The ring is 10 ft in diameter and can be moved up to 30 feet as a bonus action. 

Creatures who come into contact with the ring must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On a fail, they take 2d6 + your Charisma modifier fire damage and are forced within the ring which then closes around them and causes them to be restrained. On a save, the target takes half damage but are not captured by the ring. Creatures restrained by the ring can attempt another saving throw on their subsequent turns. Ending a turn while still restrained by the ring causes 1d6 fire damage. If your Animal Summon is within range to make an attack on the creature when it first becomes restrained, it can make a free attack roll against it. The flames from the ring shed light in a 10 foot radius, and dim light another 10 feet past that, and can set loose items around it on fire.

This ability recharges on a long rest. At level 10 you gain 2 uses of this ability between long rests.

#### The Bells and Whistles
Starting at 14th level, you can use a bardic inspiration die to create one of the greatest shows on this plane to dazzle your audience with lights and illusions. You create an illusory circus tent 30 feet high with a  20 foot radius centered on you.

While in this area, you gain the following features
* A bonus to your Performance checks equal to your Bard level
* You and your Animal summon gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws per non-ally creature up to a maximum of 5.
* You are immune to being Feared or Charmed.

Select a number of creatures within this area at the time of its creation up to half of your Bard level, and they must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw. On a fail, they all become Charmed to you, or they are blinded (your choice). They can attempt the save again at the end of any of their subsequent turns or after they take damage. If a charmed or blinded creature leaves the circus tent area, they are no longer charmed or blinded. On a success, the creature is unaffected by the illusion. Whether a targeted creature succeeds or fails the save, they cannot attack you or your Animal Summon until the start of your next turn.

You can use this feature once per long rest.

### College of the Jester


#### Joking way of life
Starting at 3rd level, through elation and laughter, you face every situation with a smile. Even in danger you evade and escape with style and wit. Whenever you are forced to make a Dexterity saving throw, you can instead use your Performance skill for the saving throw.

You also gain proficiency in a Musical Instrument and the ability to cast the Vicious Mockery cantrip. Vicious Mockery does not count against the number of known cantrips or spells for you.

#### Knee Slapper
Also at 3rd level, creating laughter truly is the best medicine, and you are able to share this medicine with those closest to you. Whenever a creature uses your Bardic Inspiration die, they gain temporary hit points for the amount they rolled on the Bardic Inspiration die and 1d4 hit points.
Additionally, if a creature rolls a natural 1-3 on an attack roll against you or an ally while they have a Bardic Inspiration die, they automatically fail their attack roll.
This threshold increases to 1-4 at 10th level.

#### Inspirational Mockery
At 6th level, the misfortune of life grants insatiable joy, and you can pocket these moments of mishap as material for a crippling delivery.

Whenever any creature automatically fails an attack roll made against a hostile creature, you gain a point of Inspirational Mockery, up to 3. As a bonus action, you can target a creature you can see and mentally fill their mind with a charmed image of the mistake you witnessed earlier. The creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against the image. On a fail, they disarm themselves of any held items, and drop prone, laughing to themselves over the experience until the end of their next turn or until they next take damage. On a successful save, the creature is unmoved by the image, and knows you tried to charm it. If the creature has 6 or less intelligence, they automatically succeed on their save.
Alternatively, you can spend a point of Inspirational Mockery as a free action to heal yourself for 1d6 health points per point spent. Inspirational Mockery points last for 5 minutes and then are removed.

#### Wait for it...

At 14th level, If you spend a Bardic Inspiration point, you can cast Vicious Mockery on up to 3 targets of your choice within 30 feet that you can see. If a creature is suffering from Inspirational Mockery, the damage dice for Vicious Mockery is increased to d6's. This particular ability is less powerful the more times a creature is subjected to it, decreasing the damage of Vicious Mockery by 1d4 per additional time it is used with this feature to a minimum of 1d4.

If a creature dies from one of these castings of Vicious Mockery, illusionary confetti appears and falls around them alongside a short celebratory horn sound, forcing hostile creatures that can see the phenomenon to make a Wisdom saving throw or be feared by you.

You can use this ability 3 times, but need 1 round between uses to rest your voice. All uses of this ability recharge on a long rest.

## Cleric
Many a person of faith follows a path marked as a righteous life by their deities. The preservation of life, nature, even things as specific as storms; all are noble pursuits, truly, but they are all smaller slices of the larger picture that governs the world. To the few enlightened enough, and privileged enough to be selected by the higher powers that govern the laws of physics and nature, a responsibility to maintain the cycle of life is entrusted the power to wield their forces.


### Time Domain
The Gods of Time - Kronos, Istus, Amaunator, Grumbar, Labelas Enoreth - uphold the most powerful and ancient law in the multiverse: Time. The Gods of time promote vitality and health but also the natural aging process of all mortals, the passing of time, day, night, and even the seasons.

```

The Gods of Fate - Aesir, Bes, Hermod, Savras, and Tyche, all share dominion over the flow of fate, fortune, and destiny. It is the power of belief to which all things will be as they should, and that those who follow in their name shall receive what they were meant to. Being in the good graces of such entities can turn your life around, and give you an edge in life. Perhaps an incoming storm dies down in the nick of time, or an opponent's foot finds an unfortunate rock to trip up their stance and give you the edge. It would be foolish to not pay such divine beings homage.

## Druid
Druids are revered as the protectors of nature, typically associated with guarding their home ecosystems and its residents. Their knowledge and wisdom allows them to be trusted more readily by the beasts of the land, and to act as envoys on their behalf when dealing with threatening forces. Some druids however have learned to harbor their worlds within themselves, opening them up to new kinds of metamorphosis and powers. These select few know and protect worlds others couldn't hope to inhabit.


### Circle of Communion
Druids of the Circle of Communion have learned to live with nature on a level beyond others. As they have met with creatures across the land, they have mixed their life energy with theirs to form mutual understanding and companionship. Using the life energy that connects all living creatures, these druids can summon in these connections for a quick assist, or to stay and help in a pinch. The more they commune with nature, the more creatures accept them and feel safe around them. This turns into friendships, respect, and an interest to keep such a creature alive. Through the fey paths that exist between realms, they watch over their wards.

#### Nature’s Entrance
At 2nd level, you gain the ability to open a hidden fey path to bring out a beast to aid you.
The beasts that you can summon depend on the Max CR you can transform into with the Wild Shape feature. As a bonus action you summon a beast of the appropriate CR, they appear in a space within 5 feet of you with a speed of 0 and get 1 attack only if they take the attack action, even if they have multi attack. They disappear at the end of your turn.

Alternatively, you can use your action to summon the creature as if using the spell Conjure Animals, but ignoring the amount of creatures summoned and the limited CR rating of the spell and instead only summoning forth a single creature. Summoned creatures can only remain for up to 1 hour, and then disappear back through the hidden fey path. They act on your turn of initiative in combat. 

You can only use this feature 2 times, and then all uses recharge on a long rest.

#### Partial Wild Shape

As you level up, you gain access to additional Partial Wild Shapes. Unless stated, you do not adopt the creatures Statistics. Unlike the normal Wildshape where you adopt the creatures hit points and use them until they are reduced to 0, returning you to your hit points at the time of transforming, you instead just add half of the creatures hit points to your maximum hit points and current hit points until the transformation ends. While transformed, you still can cast spells.


At 2nd level, you can Partial Wild Shape one of the following attributes:

```
```

**Bear Claws:** Gain the ability to use Claws from the Black Bear stat block and its Multiattack feature as well (Does not stack with other instances of Multiattack). These replace your hands.

&nbsp;


Starting at 8th level, you can Partial Wild Shape one of tthe following attributes onto yourself:

&nbsp;


**Quetzalcoatlus Bite:** Grow into a large size creature and gain the ability to use Bite from the Quetzalcoatlus stat block, gain its fly speed, and its Flyby feature. Your arms are replaced with wings, and your legs with a snake's tail.

#### Revealing the Paths
At 6th level, you master the fey hidden paths further and with more precision. You can now summon the beasts from Natures Entrance up to 15 feet away from you.

#### Land Swap

As an action, select a point you can see within 60 feet and 20 foot radius around that point is swapped with another area type of our choice of equal size.

These summoned creatures only target the last creature to inflict damage on you, and disappear after a turn passes where no creatures who have harmed you during this encounter remain. They also will leave if they are reduced to 0 hit points, the encounter ends, or you are reduced to 0 hit points. They act on your turn of initiative but cannot move more than 5 feet away from you.

### Circle of the Ocean

Druids of the Circle of the Ocean have felt a deep connection with the vast array of life at sea. Immersing themselves amongst the ocean has given them an understanding of the creatures of the deep that others could not fathom. Their natural magic from the sea is teeming with attributes not seen anywhere else, and even better they can bring them onto land.

#### Underwater Resident

|-------|---------|

|7th|Control Water, Ice Storm|
|9th|Conjure Elemental, Cone of Cold|

&nbsp;

#### Bring me the Sea

## Fighter
Being a warrior means to survive and grow. Every creature is where it is today by being a fighter in some regard. But nowadays, people train to meet a standard of performance for some baron or royalty. Fighting becomes stale, and the arts of perfecting every last movement becomes muddied amongst the numbers of armies. Save for a few, who seek to perfect their craft and excel in skillsets specialized to their abilities.


### Spear Master
The spear is one of the oldest weapons of the hunt. It has been seen in all the great battles of old, and serves today as a symbol of power, protection, and skill. Through mastery of this weapon, control of the battlefield is yours to command. With a spear and shield in hand, no threat presents itself that you cannot try to out maneuver.


#### Spear Maneuvers
Starting at 3rd level, You gain the use of 3 Spear Maneuvers of your choice, which are detailed under “ Spear Maneuvers” below. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack. 
You learn two additional maneuvers of your choice at 7th, 10th level. Each time you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one. 

Superiority Dice. You have four superiority dice, which are d8s. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest. You gain another superiority die at 7th level and one more at 15th level.

Saving Throws. Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

Maneuver save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)


#### Maneuvers

**Broadened Guard:**
You can expend one superiority die and use your reaction to guard you and any adjacent allies. While you are wielding a shield and an adjacent ally is the target of a melee attack within 5 feet, you can add half of your superiority die (minimum of 1) to their AC. This can be done only before the outcome of the attack is determined.

&nbsp;

**Charge:**
As an action, you can expend a superiority die to move up to your movement speed plus 10 feet in a straight line if you haven’t used any of your movement yet. As part of this action, you can make a weapon attack with a spear after having moved at least 20 feet. If that attack hits successfully, add 1d6 + your superiority die result to the damage.

&nbsp;

**Crippling Wound:**
You can expend one superiority die to precisely plant your spear into a weak spot on an opponent. As part of a successful weapon attack roll, you can spend a superiority die to reduce the creatures movement speed, fly speed, and or swim speed to 5ft. until the end of their next turn. Additionally, they have disadvantage on their next melee attack roll. For this attack, add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll.

&nbsp;

**Decisive Blow:**
Trying to end things quickly, you attempt a finishing blow on your opponent. As a weapon attack roll with a spear, by spending one superiority die, you increase your Critical Hit threshold to 18-20 for that attack. Add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll.

&nbsp;

**Feinting Attack:**
You can expend one superiority die and use a bonus action on your turn to feint, choosing one creature within 5 feet of you as your target. You have advantage on your next attack roll against that creature this turn. If that attack hits, add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll and that creature cannot make opportunity attacks until the start of your next turn.

&nbsp;

**Flurry:**
With deadly precision and furious speed, you make multiple attacks on your opponent. By expanding one superiority die as an action while wielding a spear, you can make a number of attack rolls at a target within range equal to the result of the superiority die. The damage for each of these attacks is 1d4 piercing damage +Strength modifier.

&nbsp;

**Lunging Strike:**
When you make a melee weapon attack on your turn, you can expend one superiority die to increase your reach for that attack by 5 feet. If you hit, you add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll.

&nbsp;

**Menacing Attack:**
When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to frighten the target. You add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it is frightened of you until the end of your next turn.

&nbsp;

**Overhead Attack:**
Raising your spear up high, you bring it down over our opponent. When you make a weapon attack roll with a spear, you can spend one superiority die to add +2 to the attack roll. If this attack roll is successful, your target must succeed on a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, they are knocked prone.

&nbsp;

**Pinning Wound:**
Either by thrusting or throwing your spear, you attempt to halt your opponent in their tracks. By spending one superiority die, you can pin your spear through your target and force them to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target is Restrained and takes Piercing damage equal to the result of the Superiority die. Add half of the superiority die (minimum of 1) to the saving throw DC. This DC persists for all future Strength checks by a creature to remove the spear. This action disarms you of your spear. 

&nbsp;

**Skewer Toss:**
Jabbing your target at the tip of your spear, you are able to make an unconventional attack. After you successfully make a weapon attack roll with a spear against a medium or smaller creature within 5 feet, you can spend one superiority die to throw the creature at another target up to 10 feet away. The new target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a fail, both creatures are knocked prone, and take damage equal to the result of the superiority die. On a save, the newly targeted creature takes half damage and is not knocked prone. The original target still is knocked prone and takes damage equal to the result of the superiority die.

**Sweeping Attack:**
When you hit a creature with an attack roll made with a spear, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to damage up to another 2 creatures with the same attack. Choose one or two creatures within 5 feet of the original target and within your reach. If the original attack roll would hit the newly selected creature(s), they take damage equal to the number you roll on your superiority die. The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.
 
&nbsp;

**Trip Attack:**
When you hit a creature with an attack roll made with a spear, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to knock the target down. You add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you knock the target prone.
 
&nbsp;

**Pushing Attack:**
When you hit a creature with an attack roll made with a spear, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to drive the target back. You add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you push the target up to 15 feet away from you.
 
&nbsp;

**Parry:**
When another creature damages you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to reduce the damage by the number you roll on your superiority die + your Dexterity modifier.

#### Tip of the Spear
Starting at 7th level, Spears gain the Finesse property when wielded by you. Also, if you spend a bonus action, you can make your attack rolls into Lunging Strikes until the end of your turn. You can only use this feature once per long rest.

#### Deadly Toss
At 10th level, your deadliness with the spear increases to an uncanny expertise. When you use your spear as part of a thrown weapon attack, the range is increased by 30 feet and you add +3 to your attack roll for this attack. Your critical hit threshold is increased to 19-20 as well. 

#### Improved Combat Superiority
At 15th level, your superiority dice turn into d12s.

#### Exampliary charge
At 18th level, when you first enter an encounter, you take the initiative in battle to set the tone. You can choose to gain a +3 bonus to your initiative, and for the first round you will gain the following benefits:
* You gain an additional 10 feet of movement speed.
* On a single successful  weapon attack roll, you may apply a free use of any Spear Maneuver without spending a superiority die.
* You gain a +1 bonus to AC.
* You do not trigger attacks of opportunity.
* Allies within 5ft. of you at the start of your turn gain 1d6 temporary hit points

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### Tempest Blade

Though you have access to the arcane, trying to bring it forth the ways a sorcerer or wizard might has proven fruitless. Instead, your blade in battle is where it naturally comes forth, and so you let it blossom on the field in physical combat. Thunder booms, wounds chill over, and lightning cracks as your blade rips through foes. Even your movements gain aid from these forces of nature that swell within you. Whenever you enter the field, the enemy knows a storm is approaching.


#### The Calm
Starting at 3rd level, some of the magical energy within you builds up as you take hits, getting ready to unleash itself in a devastating form. As you take hits, you will roll 1d4 per hit and gain the following Charge as listed below.
No charge is gained

* 1 charge of of Thunder damage is generated
* 1 charge of Cold damage is generated
* 1 charge of Lightning damage is generated

You can store up to 3 charges, and all charges are lost at the end of your turn. 1 charge of your choice can be added to your next attack roll, but are lost if your attack misses. Each charge provides an additional 1d4 damage of the relevant type. You can store up to 4 charges at 10th level, and at 18th level, the charges now deal for 1d10 damage of the relevant type.

#### Technical Block
Starting at 7th level, You can take the chance of a risky block to allow yourself to get better positioning.
When you are the target of a melee attack roll, before the roll is made you can use your reaction to attempt a Technical Block. By performing a Technical Block, you try to directly block the attack with your weapon, instead of dodging or using a shield. This lowers your AC for the attack by 2, but if the attack against you fails, the following benefits take effect until the end of your next turn. 
* The attacking creature’s speed is reduced to 0.
* You gain advantage on all attack rolls against the creature.
* The creature cannot benefit from the Multiattack feature until the start of its next turn.
* You can choose to swap locations with the attack creature.

#### Storm the Lines
At 10th level, You can use your bonus action to Dash, as magical winds propel you forward. All creatures who are within 5 feet of you when you first take the Dash action with this feature take 1d4 cold damage. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (Minimum of 1). All uses of this feature recharge on a short or long rest

#### Lightning Fueled
At 15th level, Your muscles course with lightning at all times, allowing you to hasten your reactions and gain resistance to Lightning damage. Whenever you perform an attack of opportunity, instead of a normal melee weapon attack, you can unleash a flurry of slashes. Roll 1d6 and you can make that many attack rolls against the creature. The weapon die for all of these attacks becomes a 1d6 . This ability can only be used once per encounter.


<div class='pageNumber'>15</div>
<div class='footnote'>PART 2 | FIGHTER</div>
\page

#### Storm Stance
At 18th level, You become a weapon of nature as lightning leaks from your eyes, and you hover above the ground, held aloft by cycloning winds. As an action, you can enter Storm Stance and gain the following benefits.

* Your movement speed is increased by 10 feet, and you are no longer affected by difficult terrain.
* Before making an attack roll, you can spend 3 charges of The Calm to attack all creatures within a 30 foot cone originating from you with the attack.
* All of your elemental damage dice from The Calm and the Lightning Fueled features inflict an additional 1d4 damage.

Storm Stance lasts for 1 minutes or until you end it with a free action. This feature can only be used once before it needs to recharge with a long rest.

### Shield Knight

Knights are often touted as champions of battles, slaying enemies left and right with little error. While this can be true, it is a romanticized version of the title that misses the key aspect of becoming a knight. One becomes a knight to protect that which they value above all else. They are the sword of their master when necessary, but always their shield. A knight who cannot defend that which matters, is worthy to only be called a soldier at best. In service to that which matters, a shield knight stands firm in the face of any and all opposition.

#### Shield of the People
Starting at 3rd level, You gain the strength to stand against all threats. All shields for you now can be used in attack rolls as an offhand weapon if you are wielding a weapon in the other hand, or on their own as simple weapons. Shields gain the Versatile property for you when used as weapons, and do damage based on their material. Wooden shields hit for 1d6 bludgeoning damage (1d8 versatile) , metal shields hit for 1d8 bludgeoning damage (1d10 versatile), and adamantine shields hit for 1d10 bludgeoning damage (1d12 versatile). Unless stated otherwise, most shields are metal.

Additionally, you can use your reaction to add +2 AC to any ally that is within 5 feet of you who is the target of a melee or ranged attack before the attack roll is made. While wielding a shield however, your speed is lowered by 5 feet.

```
```

#### Wall Assault
At 7th level, your shield is no longer just a means of protecting, but also a proper offensive option. You gain 1 use of each of the following maneuvers per long rest so long as you are wielding a shield. The DC for creatures to save against for some of your abilities is equal to (8 + Proficiency bonus + Strength modifier).

&nbsp;


**Bulldozer:** As an action, you can stampede up to 20 feet in a straight line, assaulting everyone along your path. Make an attack roll with your shield against all creatures within your line or who are within 5 feet of it. On a successful attack, that creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or be knocked prone. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity

&nbsp;


**Rebuttal:** In response to a creature failing a melee attack roll against you from within 5 ft, you may attack them immediately after as a free action with a shield. This attack gets a +1 bonus to the attack roll and damage roll for every bonus to AC your shield grants.

&nbsp;


**Immovable:** As a reaction, you can choose to cancel the effects of an action that would cause you to be moved against your will up to 15 feet, drop prone, or become disarmed.

&nbsp;

**Shield Toss:** As an action, you can throw your shield at an enemy within 15 feet as a weapon attack. This attack does an extra weapon die of damage on a successful hit. Whether your attack is successful or not, your shield drops into the nearest unoccupied space between you and the target.

&nbsp;

You gain a second use of each of these actions per long rest at 10th level.

#### Guardian Will
At 10th level, Your body and mind are one in resolution, allowing you to withstand further threats of even a mystical nature. Add your Constitution modifier to any Wisdom saving throws while you are wielding a shield. 

#### Mountainous Resolve
At 15th level, Your body is used to punishment and is now quite adept at taking it. 2 times per long rest, you can reduce 2d6 damage from an attack that has harmed you as a reaction. Additionally, if you were to be reduced to 0 hit points or less, after reducing the damage from an attack, you instead are reduced to 1 hit point, dropping all held and wielded items and falling prone.

#### Aegis
At 18th level, You can use your bonus action to bolster your body and mind against all threats. Until the start of your next turn, you mitigate 10+2d10 damage from all sources of damage. This can be used once per long rest.

## Monk

Through self exploration, it isn't hard to see that many a practitioner of monk traditions would awaken to unique and powerful control over their Ki and body. Some wield tremendous forces of nature through their own control, while others tune their body into the natural state of flow of lifes energy. Whether in peace, or through duty, they each are forces of ferocity and respect.

### Way of Lightning

What many a monk calls Ki, or a spiritualist calls soul, Monks of the way of lightning recognize this latent potential as the dormant biology that the body can obtain. Life is energy, and energy turned physical becomes lightning, one needs only to truly understand this to reach out to this source. By doing so, the limits of the body are released, and your life force becomes an existential weapon or defense for you to manipulate.

#### Charged Dash
Starting at 3rd level, whenever you use your Step of the Wind feature, you can now move quickly enough to move through a creatures square unhindered by difficult terrain and without meeting the 2 sizes larger or smaller requirement. Any creature you pass through in this manner is hit for 1d4 lightning damage. If you use this feature, you gain resistance to lightning damage for 1 minute.

#### Lightning Reflexes
Also at 3rd level, your reactions to danger are increased by lightning coursing through your muscles. When you are the target of a melee attack roll, you can use your reaction and a Ki Point to impose disadvantage on the attack. If the attack misses, you can make 1 unarmed strike against that attacking creature if they are within range. If you use this feature, you gain resistance to lightning damage for 1 minute.

#### Electric Disruption
At 6th level, you can charge up an unarmed strike attack with pure electrical energy. Spend 3 ki points, and gain +1d4 lightning damage for all unarmed strikes for 1 minute. Creatures harmed by unarmed strikes charged by this feature have their Dexterity score reduced by 1 for 5 minutes up to a maximum of 2. The lightning damage increases to 1d16 at 11th level.

#### Channel Lightning
Starting at 11th level, your body can now charge more electrical energy than it can handle. As an action, you can now spend 3 ki points to cast the spell Lightning Bolt, or 5 Ki points to cast the spell Chain Lightning without the material components.

```
```

#### Lightning Body
Starting at 17th level, you can overload your body with electricity and maintain it around you so that you now are living lightning. By expending 5 ki points, you can transform for 1 minute and gain the following benefits.

* Your movement speed is increased by 15 feet and you can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. A creature that touches you or hits you with a melee attack while within 5 feet takes 3 lightning damage.
* You also have advantage on all Dexterity saving throws.

* You shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light in an additional 30 feet.

* You are immune to lightning damage

* If you touch at least a 5 cubic foot body of water, you electrocute it but at the cost of some of your power. All creatures within 5 feet of the point you touch the water take 2d12 lightning damage, creatures within 10 feet take 2d10 lightning damage, and creatures within 15 feet take 2d8 lightning damage. Creatures only take damage from the largest damage die amount based on their proximity, not a collective amount. When this is done however, you take 2d4 force damage and end your lightning form.

## Way of the Runic Body

### Sacred Body
Starting at 3rd level, you unlock certain blocks on your Ki, and runes appear as engravings on your body. Your first Ki you unlock engraves your wrists and forearms and adds 1d4 force damage to all hits with Flurry of Blows. This increases to 2d4 at 11th level and 3d4 at 17th level.

#### Chakra Sync
Additionally at 3rd level, you become accustomed to the raw arcane energy in the world as it mingles with you Ki, granting you Proficiency in Arcana (Wisdom) skill checks. You can now cast Detect Magic as an action for 2 Ki Points. And you can also regenerate a Ki Point if you reduce a creature with an unused spell slot to 0 hit points with an unarmed strike. 

#### Awakened Step
At 6th level, you unlock another block on your Ki as engravings appear on your feet, granting your movements an element borderlining levitation.

After you use 3 Ki Points within 1 minute of each other, you gain the following benefits for 3 rounds: 
* Your footsteps become silent.
* You ignore non-magical difficult terrain.

At 17th level, your teleport is increased to 20 feet.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

```
```



#### Durable Body
Starting at 11th level, Your next Ki is unlocked and engravings appear on your back. After you hit a creature with Flurry of Blows, you increase your AC by 1 for each successful hit you land until the start of your next turn. This can only occur once per round.

### Way of the Lotus Palm

Additionally at 3rd level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the Cleric spell list. The Way of the Lotus Palm table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cleric spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of Cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + Charisma modifier. The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

</div>

#### Spellcasting Ability
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your practice. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

&nbsp;


**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

&nbsp;


**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

```
```

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier.

All uses of this feature recharge on a long rest.

A creature hit by this spear takes 4d6 radiant damage. If the target is undead, you can add a free use of the Searing Smite spell as part of the attack. If this spear is thrown and misses, as a reaction, you can teleport it back to your hand.

A spear can only last for 1 minute before disappearing. Ending your turn with the spear held by you hurts you for 1d4 radiant damage. When your spear would shatter after successfully harming a creature, roll 1d4, and on a 4, a new spear appears in your hand.

**Escort of Passing** You can use your Channel Divinity as an action to pray to your deity with your holy symbol and ask that you be able to bridge the living and dead to ferry those stuck between. Doing this allows you to sense any undead or see ghosts within 200 feet for 1 hour. Any ability checks or attack rolls made against creatures affected by this ability have advantage. Any undead revealed from this cannot divulge any information like the Speak with Dead spell would normally allow. Any slain undead, or ghosts convinced to move on to the otherside with a Wisdom (Religion) ability check pleases your deity and grant you 10 temporary hit points for 1 hour.

#### The Call of Valhalla
Starting at 7th level, when you fall below half of your hit point maximum, you and all allies within 15 feet gain 1d8+1 temporary hit points. At 18th level, the temporary hit points increase to 2d8+1. Once per short rest.

#### Steed of Devotion
Starting at 15th level, your deity acknowledges your growth and commitment to be amongst the highest of their followers and awards you a steed so that you may better carry out their divine agenda.

You may choose between the Pegasus or the Griffin listed below to be your steed. If you do not share a known language with your chosen mount, they learn one language that you know.

At 18th level, your chosen mount gains 15 more hit points.

You gain advantage on saving throws made to avoid falling off our mount. If you do fall off your mount and descend no more than 10 feet, you can land on your feet without taking damage if you are not incapacitated.

Should your mount die, you may perform the necessary burial ritual with 8 hours of intesnsive prayer and ask your deity to unite you with another companion to carry out their will. Roll 1d12 and a new mount will be granted to you in an amount of days equal to the result. If you are unable to give the proper burial rites to your fallen mount within 24 hours, the time is increased to 2d12.

### Oath of Liberation

Paladins who pursue the Oath of the Liberation seek to free the souls of all from anything holding them down. Freedom and free will are the truest treasures of life and those who would rob an individual of that must be halted from doing so. Whatever is for the greater good is what the Paladin will ultimately choose on how to ensure the freedom of others, but will resort to killing as a last resort, as it is the ultimate act of theft. Tyrants should beware their methods and practices when a Paladin of Liberation gets wind of them, as they are famous for leading the people to new eras of freedom.

#### Tenents of Devotion
Though the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Liberation vary per path, paladins of this oath typically share these tenets.

&nbsp;


**Courage.** Through fear of death we see ourselves for who we truly are. And I shall not run from my fears.

&nbsp;


**Honor.** I need not unsheath my weapon without reason, but I shall not wield it without valor.

&nbsp;


**Free Will.** Each life is precious in that it can be lived however it wants. Others have no right to say otherwise.

&nbsp;


**The People’s Champion.** To be a paladin, one must be the paladin of the people. You are their holy sword and shield in the face of injustice and malice in the world. 


#### Channel Divinity
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity Options 

#### Brand of the Oppressor
As an action, you can use your Channel Divinity to try and mark a number of creatures equal to your Charisma modifier that you can see within 60 feet with the Brand of the Oppressor.

Selected creatures must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be branded with a black and red sigil on their body. Creatures with the Brand of the Oppressor cannot impose disadvantage onto creatures through the effects of spells or features and cannot benefit from advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, or saving throws. If a creature with a Mark of the Oppressor causes another creature to become Paralyzed, Restrained, or Stunned, they too are affected by the same condition at that time.

This mark lasts as long as the creatures remain within 60 feet of you, or after 5 minutes passes.

#### Barrier of Cleansing
As a reaction, you can use your Channel Divinity to select up to 3 allies within 60 feet to be surrounded by a white and yellow sphere of energy.

These allies are immediantly cleansed of all conditions except Incapacitated and Unconscious, and have the spells Featherfall and Resistance cast on them. If the creatures were Restrained or Grappled, they move 5 feet into the nearest unoccupied space.


```
```

##### Oath of the Valkyrie Spells
| Paladin Level | Spells |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 3rd  | Command, Hunter's Mark |
| 5th  | Hold Person, Silence |
| 9th  | Beacon of Hope, Fear |
| 13th | Freedom of Movement, Death Ward |
| 17th | Awaken, Dominate Person |

#### Aura of Freedom
Starting at 7th level, you and allies within 20 feet of you cannot have their movement reduced or be Restrained by magical means. They also have advantage against any checks to escape grapples.
At 18th level, your aura’s range increases to 30 feet.

#### Retribution of the Slave
Starting at 15th level, you can use your divine presence to free allies who have had their freedom stolen from them. While an ally within 10 feet of you is charmed, you can use your reaction to end the charm immediately and cause 2d6 psychic damage against the source of the charm.

#### Liberation
At 20th level, you become the beacon of freedom, and the nightmare of oppressors. As a bonus action, you can swear an oath to the free will of life to gain the following benefits for 1 minute:

Your Aura of Freedom increases to 40 feet in range and now grants immunity to Fear
You are immune to becoming Paralyzed or Stunned.
All allies who start their turn within your Aura of Freedom have the spell Heroism cast upon them once per encounter and gain 10 feet of movement speed until the end of their turn.

When you or a creature within your Aura of Freedom is the target of a melee attack roll, you can ask the DM if the attacking creatures Strength modifier is higher than the target creatures. If the attacking creatures Strength modifier is indeed higher than the target creatures, the attacking creature loses their proficiency bonus to their attack roll if it was benefiting from it.

## Ranger

With the passing of time, the traditional huntsman has had to adapt to the ever changing environment. New tricks have been developed and passed down as time has marched forward, breeding new types of rangers into the wild. With each generation, the bar of skill is raised higher, and the precision of their aim is as sharp as their wit. Whatever methods they implore, you should hope that one of them is never on your trail.

### Urban Grounds
The idea that a ranger is one who skulks the woods and wilds is outdated and so limiting. There are so many skills that a city can teach you that can't be learned without strangers around. the name of the game is the same, but now you need to outsmart others who can scheme and think, not just the instincts of a beast. Besides, what is a city besides a jungle within walls.


#### Local hunter
At 3rd level, you learn Thieves Cant and choose one of the following features. You gain another feature from this selection at 11th level.

&nbsp;


**City Scaler.**
Gain a climb speed of 30 feet and proficiency in Acrobatics (Dex) and Athletics (Str)

&nbsp;


**Blending in.**
Gain the spells Disguise Self and Expeditious Retreat as Ranger spells.

&nbsp;


**Local Gossip.**
Gain advantage on any Charisma skill checks or Charisma saving throws against non hostile targets.

&nbsp;


**Born behind walls.**
While in an urban setting, your movement speed is increased by 10 feet. You can use your bonus action to take the Dash, Dodge, or Disengage action if a hostile creature is within 5 feet.

#### Relentless
At 7th level, you can unleash a storm of projectiles at a foe with every move they make. 

As an action, target a creature within range, and make 2 weapon attack rolls against them. If either of these attacks hit, you can  use your reaction on that creatures turn to make attacks rolls with advantage on that creature at the start of their movement and again at the end of their movement so long as you still can make the attacks against them.

If the creature does not move, you cannot make these attacks. You can use this feature 2 times per long rest.

```
```



#### Improvised Position
At 11th level, you now have an unique understanding of how to use height and obstructions to your advantage. You no longer suffer from disadvantage on attack rolls with ranged weapons from being prone. This only applies against a target if they are no more than 5 feet above you.

#### Adaptation
At 15th level, your expertise at navigating a city improves. Choose three of the following features to gain. You can change 1 feature you benefit from by spending 8 hours exploring and examining an area.

&nbsp;


**Evasion.** When you are subjected to an effect, such as a red dragon’s fiery breath or a lightning bolt spell, that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw and only half the damage if you fail. You cannot gain this feature alongside Uncanny Dodge.

&nbsp;


**Uncanny Dodge.** When an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you. You cannot gain this feature alongside Evasion.

&nbsp;


**Sticky Fingers.** You can add your Charisma modifier to any Sleight of Hand skill checks and when you use your action to make a Sleight of Hand check in combat, you gain advantage if you were not the target of the creatures last attack.

&nbsp;


**Blending in.** Gain a +5 bonus to all Stealth rolls.

&nbsp;


**Pick from a Crowd.** Gain a +5 bonus to Perception skill checks.

&nbsp;


**Alleyway Scrapper.** When you have solid walls at least 10 feet tall on at least 2 sides of you within 10 feet, you gain a +1 to AC and a +1 to attack rolls and saving throws. Additionally, you do not suffer from attacks of opportunity if both you and the creature are in these conditions.

### Trapper
What many of the local hunters seem to have forgotten is the value of patience when pursueing prey. Meticulously tracking your quarry and learning their habits puts you in a mindset fit to have them trigger their own demise. But digging pits and laying net traps is how the old world did things, as Trapper's nowadays have the means to magically create their own, with a twist. Never pursue a trapper unless you plan to follow tem by tiptoeing the whole way.

#### Arcane Traps
At 3rd level, as an action you can place a magical sigil on unoccupied flat ground within 5 feet of you by touching that area. The sigil is hidden by illusion and is only seen by you unless detected by magic, or seen by creatures that can see invisible objects. The sigil takes up a full 5 foot diameter area and can have nothing in the area when it is placed but can then be covered by objects or creatures.

A trap is triggered when a creature is directly above the sigil and you use a Reaction to activate it. You are aware when a creature is over the sigil, but no other specifics as to what the creature is or who it is.

A trap lasts for 8 hours and then dissipates, or if Dispel Magic is cast on it. You may only have one trap active at a time, and laying a new trap erases the old one. You can also spend 5 minutes to remove an unused trap and not have it deplete a use of this feature. Any saving throws required by your traps uses your Spell save DC.

&nbsp;


You learn 3 types of traps to start from the options below. You learn 2 more at 7th level, another 2 at 11th level, and 1 more at 15th level. Each time you learn a new trap, you can replace any trap you know with a different one.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of 1). You regain all expended uses on a long rest.

At 11th level, all traps that cause damage gain an additional 1d4 of their respective damage types.


#### Traps
**Crippling Trap.** When this trap is activated, the creature within it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a fail, the detonating creatures body stiffens and they then grant advantage to any melee attack rolls against them and have disadvantage on all melee attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws until the end of its next turn.

4. 30 feet and up to 10 feet in any other direction

If the creature is Large or larger or on a successful save, they are unaffected by this trap. Should a launched creature land on another creature, that second creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw, or take 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet the initial creature fell onto them. On a save they take no damage. The initial creature is moved to an unoccupied square after the saving throw is attempted.

At 9th level, an additional 10 feet in height is added to all outcomes.

&nbsp;

On a fail, a 5 foot diameter trench opens up below the creature to 10 feet down as if affected by the Move Earth spell. The creature takes any appropriate falling damage and is then sealed in from above and an X is drawn into the above earth over the pocket underground. The earth above has hit points equal to 4 times your Ranger level and once depleted crumbles so the trench is no longer sealed. On a successful save, the creature moves to an unoccupied space within 5 feet.

At 9th level, the Dexterity saving throw requirement against this trap increases by 1.

&nbsp;


**Stored Spell Trap.** You can infuse this trap with a 2nd level or lower spell that is released upon detonation and treats the creature above the sigil as the target of the spell. All spell effects use your Spell attack roll and Spell saving throw DC.

At 9th level, you can store up to a 3rd level spell within this trap.

&nbsp;

### Skillshot Archer
The intuition of a hunter is the difference on getting the uppe hand on a target, or letting it give you the slip. However, even while predicting every move is impossible, there are plenty of options to adapt to these sudden changes. Skillshot Archers pride themselves on hitting the once in a million shots at a rather reliable rate. Many a Only a fool makes a bet with one of these rangers only to regret it soon after.

## Rogue
With all the changes in the world, picking the right targets for rogues has been become more important. To aid their craft, some have delved further into the folds of magic that now floats around the world to aid their endeavors. While others simply decided to face these challenges head on by becoming more capable and strong. With folks like these lurking around, many a city treat even the simplest criminal as a dangerous threat to society. Too bad the ones they seem to catch are nothing but common pickpockets.

### Shadow Dagger
Your time of dabbling with magic to benefit your hobbies of mischief seems to have paid off. Whether from accidental encounters or excruciating study, you made contact with the Plane of Shadows successfully and it left you with a gift. Darkness now feels like a second home, and your movements are ignored. Those who cross you better watch their back, because you’re very likely to be right there before they realize it. 

#### Dark Refuge
Starting at 3rd level, you gain advantage on all Stealth checks made in dim light or darker. If you are invisible, you gain an extra die of Sneak Attack damage for any attacks made while being invisible.

#### Shadow Start

```
```

The shadow reaches out from its plane, and attempts to ensnare its owner.

The targeted creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw with a saving DC equal to (10+proficiency bonus+Wisdom modifier). If the creature fails, it is restrained by its own shadow. The creature can attempt a new save at the end of each of its subsequent turns. On a successful save, the creature is not captured by the shadow and it returns to normal.

### Mage Hunter
Lots of spellcasters worry little about a normal person getting the drop on them. They become arrogant and reliant on their magic to save them and do the work for them. But you are here to remind them that they are nothing without their wands and incantations. When it comes down to it, the only thing their fancy words will do is paint a target on their backs for you. All there ever is to do is dance the dance til they’re cornered by you. That’s your favorite part.

You can use this feature twice between long rests.

#### Bane of Mages
At 9th level, your familiarity with arcana has allowed you to redirect some of its impact away from you. Whenever you are targeted by a spell and damaged by fire, lightning, cold, thunder, poison, acid, or force damage, you can reduce the total damage taken by 1d4+1 per level spell slot of the spell cast.

Additionally, you ignore the effects of Mage Armor on creatures when making your attack rolls against them.

#### Magic Leech
At 13th level, When you succeed on a melee weapon attack roll against a creature that has spell slots, you can rob them of their spell slots to increase your damage or benefit yourself. As part of your successful attack roll, you can reach into their arcanic energy and use one of their second highest level spell slots (Minimum of 1st level) to cause 1 of 2 effects.
* Add unmitigatable magical damage to your attack equal to 1d8 per spell slot level stolen
* Create a magical shield for yourself, granting you immunity to Magic Missile and gain +1 AC per spell slot level of the stolen slot  until the start of your next turn.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (Minimum of 1). All uses of this feature recharge on a long rest.

```
```

#### New Trick
At 17th level, you have hunted so many magic users, and turned their own craft against them that some of the exposure has left you with an ability all your own. As an action, you can roll 1d4 and gain all of the effects equal to your rolled number and lower. (Ex. If you roll a 3, you gain the benefits of effects 1, 2, and 3.)
1. Become invisible as if casting the spell Invisibility and teleport 10 feet to any unoccupied location.
2. Leave an illusion of yourself in your current location as if using the spell Major Image. You decide what it is doing at the time of creation.
3. Gain a single use of Misty Step. If you already have Misty step, then your next usage of Misty Step within 1 hour gains 30 feet of range.
4. Your next successful attack roll against a creature that can cast spells disrupts them, forcing them to make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of (8+proficiency bonus+Intelligence modifier). On a fail they cannot cast spells, but can reattempt their saving throw at the end of each of their subsequent turns..

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (Minimum of 1). All uses of this feature recharge on a long rest.

### Ruffian

Just because you travel with the crowd most people describe as rogues doesn’t mean you have to be a weak little pipsqueak. Ruffians revel in being skilled brawlers with and without a blade. They get through life by not trusting others and alway plotting on the best way and time to turn the tables on someone they are working with. You’ll typically find them at the local tavern, regaling their past glories while waiting for the right work to come their way so they can add to their list. They will work with who they have to for their own ends, and definitely have those they consider friends. But they owe their survival to their cautious nature, and are always looking for their next score.



#### Brutish Blow
Starting at 3rd level, you can add your Strength modifier to the damage roll of any successful Sneak Attack.

If a creature you hit with sneak attack is the same size or smaller than you, you can challenge them to a Strength contest. If you are victorious, you push them down with your attack and make them become prone. If they are victorious, you have disadvantage on attack rolls against them them until the end of your next turn.

#### Raised to Take a Hit
Also at 3rd level, your hit die for being a Rogue changes to 1d10. This increases your hit points maximum by 3 immediately. For all future Rogue levels, you now increase your maximum hit points by 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier.

You also gain proficiency in Strength saving throws.

#### Forceful hits
At 9th level, your unarmed strikes now hit for 1d4 + Strength modifier bludgeoning damage. On top of that, any attacks you perform without a Finesse or Ranged weapon can still activate your Sneak Attack , but with 1 less die than your normal Sneak Attack die amount. This however does not affect weapons with the Two-handed property.

#### Solo Fighter
At 13th level, If there is no other creature within 5 feet of you when you take the attack action, you can perform an additional attack as if you had Extra Attack. If you already have Extra Attack from a different source, you do not gain an additional attack.

```
```

#### Fiendish Throw
At 17th level, when you successfully hit a creature with Sneak attack, before calculating damage, you can challenge them to a Strength contest to try and hoist them up instead of just knocking them pron. If you are victorious in the contest and the creature is large or smaller, you hoist them into the air by the wound, causing you to automatically maximize half of your sneak Attack die used. You then can throw them up to 10 feet in any direction, causing an additional 1d6 bludgeoning damage from impact and to be knocked prone. If they collide with another Large or smaller creature, that additional creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your earlier Strength contest result or take the bludgeoning damage as well and be knocked prone. On a save, they take half damage and are not knocked prone. If the additional creature is Huge or larger, they will take no damage or be knocked prone.
If your original target creature is victorious in the contest, your attack damages them as normal but nothing further happens.

You can use this feature 2 times per long rest.

## Sorcerer
In an era of dragons, gods, and arcane forces, it is a miracle that anything but those things exists still at all. Yet, it is this very tenacity that has enabled the magic of the world to grow ever more powerful, and able to change to course of history. It is a heavy responsibility that sorcerers carry, as direct conduits of limitless magical forces. In every person touched by magic, they develop their own unique connection with it. Whether it be treading the thin line between life and death, or the natural elements that the inhabitants of this world mastered to rise above their primitive nature, Sorcerers are seekers of mastery to their power and potential. 

### Necromantic Sorcery
Necromancers get a rather distasteful reputation from the few bad apples who abuse their power. A normal necromancer finds respectable work in sacred places as a giver of closure to mourning families, or as investigators to mysterious murders for the city guard. But people tend to get the wrong idea when you treat a body as just a thing, which it is. The soul that inhabits a body is what is sacred; a fact you try to remind others of often. But alas, many have a hard time separating the two. But with this power, at least there are many possibilities available to your companionship.


#### Lost Essence
Starting at 1st level, you can try to capture any lingering life essence in a corpse that is less than 1 hour old into your spellcasting focus by spending 5 minutes sending them to the other side through a ritual of somatic and verbal rites but keeping some of their Essence they don’t need for yourself. The corpse must be intact and missing very little of its body. The creature must be at least medium in size, or be a Halfling, Dwarf, or Gnome. You cannot collect Essence from remains that have been reanimated once already.

You can store up to 3 Essences at 1st level. As a bonus action, you can access your stored Essences and spend as many as you have to gain one of the following benefits.
Gain 4 temporary hit points per Essence spent up to a maximum of 20. These temporary hit points last for 4 hours.
Heal 1d6+1 hit points per Essence spent
You can spend 2 essences to cast a Necromancy spell as 1 level higher than normal.
Select a number of creatures you can see equal to the number of Essences spent. Make a Stealth check against each creature against their Perception check. If the creature is unaware of you, you have advantage on this roll. If you succeed on your Stealth check, you are Invisible to that creature until the end of your turn.
You can convert 2 Essences to 1 Sorcerer point

You can store a total of 4 Essences at 14th level.

#### Necromancy Specialist
Also starting at 1st level, Animate Dead, Create Undead, Raise Dead, Resurrection, Revivify, Spare the Dying, Speak with Dead, Toll the Dead, True Resurrection, and Vampiric Touch become Sorcerer Spells for you. Whenever you successfully cast one of these spells, you also gain 1d4 hit points.

With this expertise, you can also identify the race of any remains by spending 1 minute examining them.

```
```

#### Bone Head
At 6th level, You gain resistance to Necrotic damage and can now turn skulls into a servant for a short time. As an action, you can touch a skull of a creature that has been dead for more than 1 year, to animate it. The animated skull has the stats listed below and rolls its own initiative.

The skull is friendly to you only and it obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to the skull, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions. A skull must be of a medium or smaller creature. The skull disintegrates to ash after 1 minute or is reduced to 0 hit points. You can only control 2 skulls at a time. If you choose to control a 3rd, the one with the lowest hit points disintegrates. If all active skull are at the same health, the one that was summoned first disintegrates.

If the Animated skull is damaged while it is using Haunting Flutter, it no longer is pestering the creature.

#### Never Forgotten
At 14th level, you can try and scan the area to find a humanoid corpse buried beneath the earth. So long as you are on soft earth or swamp, as a bonus action, you can roll a d4 to see how many corpses or skeletons you are able to magically phase to the surface. Roll 1d4 to determine what happens as listed below:

1. You do not find any corpse or skeleton to raise up. 
2. You bring up 1 corpse or skeleton. 
3. You bring up 1 corpse or skeleton. 
4. You bring up 2 corpses or skeletons.

The DM can decide for a different type of corpse or skeleton other than humanoid to be brought up, but it is of a medium or smaller creature. These corpses or skeletons spawn within 10 feet of you, and Corpses or skeletons raised from this feature magically phase back into the ground where they originally were raised from after 1 minute of not being used in a spell, regardless of where they are at that time. This feature can only be performed once per short rest.

Furthermore, anytime you raise a creature using a spell, the raised creature now adopts your Dex. Modifier  and Cha. Modifier if yours is higher than the creatures original modifier, They also gain +2 to their AC, and 3 additional Hit Points per your Con. Modifier (Minimum of 1).

#### The Sanctity of Life
At 18th level, you can now combine essences into your raised minions and even fuse corpses together to make a true masterpiece of revival arcana.

As a bonus action, you can infuse one of your stored Essences into a creature raised with a spell and give it one of the following benefits. A creature can have each benefit used on it once, and cannot have the benefit reapplied again.

* Heal the creature for 2d8 hit points and give it 2d8 temporary hit points.
* Raise the creatures AC by +2 and give it +2 to its Str. Score, Dex. Score, and Cha. Score
* Increase the creatures speed by 10 feet, and grant the creature the ability to cast the spell Inflict Wounds one time at 1st level. It’s spell attack bonus is equal to yours for this casting.

You can also now fuse 2 corpses into a Fused Zombie or Fused Skeleton that has 2 heads, 4 arms, and 4 legs, or 3 corpses into a Greater Zombie or Greater Skeleton. When you use a spell to raise a corpse or skeleton, and another corpse or skeleton is within 5 feet of it, you can spend 1 additional spell slot of the same level to combine them into a Fused Zombie/Skeleton. If there are 3, you can spend 3 spell slots to combine them into a Greater Zombie/Skeleton. A fused creature is separated back into its original pieces whenever the effects of the spell that resurrected it end.

### Elementalist

Shaped by the forces of nature, you have learned to bend them to your will by being in harmony with them in body and mind. Sorcerers with their origins in the elements often attribute their awakening to their powers through a landmark moment in their life where they first became one with their element. Often through a journey to find one's self or surviving a tremendously difficult trial versus nature.

#### Gaia Source
Your magical prowess comes from the world around you, all you do is shape it to your needs. Because of this, you do not excel at mastering many of the spells other spellcasters boast about, instead, you compete by witty combinations of your world shaping. Taking this Sorcerer Origin cuts your known spells by 3 with a minimum of 2 (This does not affect your known cantrips). You learn the spells listed in the Elemental Origin spells as you level up, and they count as Sorcerer spells for you and do not count towards the total number of spells known for you.

At 1st level, you choose two Cantrips and two first level spells to learn from the Elementalist spell list. You gain another cantrip and  1st level spell from the list at 3rd level, and the remaining cantrip and 1st level spell at 5th level. At 18th level, you learn the Overload spell from the Elementalist spell list


##### Elementalist Spells
| Sorcerer Level | Spells |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 1st  | Air Cannon, Combustion, Crag Dome, Earthen Pillar, Flaring Mote, Ice Shards, Sweeping Wave, Tornado Glide |
| 18th  | Overload |


#### Familiar Precision
At 6th level, your spells can be fused with your personal supply of arcane energy. When you cast a spell from the Elementalist spell list, you can spend 1 sorcery point to increase the total damage die used by 1. You can also spend 2 sorcery points to mimic this affect for a spell not on the Elementalist spell list.

#### Natural Fuel
At 14th level, you gain the ability to manipulate elements around you for your defense or spell slot replenishment. As an action, you can absorb a bit of natural energy from a source in the world within 30 feet to restore a spell slot equal to half your proficiency bonus. What counts as a source is listed below, as well as the alternative defensive option it offers.
The absorbing option can cost as many sorcery points as you see fit, while the defensive option only requires one. All defensive options are reactions and can be used after an attack against you is declared, but before the outcome is determined.

&nbsp;


**Air.** A non-magical wind that is strong enough to blow out a torch can be absorbed to replenish a spell slot. This can only be done once per short rest.

Alternatively, if you have the open sky above you, as a reaction you can spend a sorcery point to summon a downward gust of wind whenever you are the target of a ranged weapon attack to impose a -1d10 penalty on the attack roll.

&nbsp;


**Water.** A clean source of water that is at least 30 cubic feet in size can be absorbed to replenish a spell slot. This can only be done once per short rest.

Alternatively, when you are the target of a spell attack roll, if there is a source of water within 10ft. of you of at least 10 cubic feet in size, you can spend a sorcery point to pull forth a wave of the water and mix it with you magic to impose a -1d10 penalty on the attack roll.

&nbsp;


**Earth.** Ore or crystal of at least 10 cubic feet in size can be absorbed to replenish a spell slot. This can only be done once per short rest.

Alternatively, when you are the target of a melee attack, you can spend a sorcery point to pull earth directly beneath you up to you and give you +1d4 AC against the attack.

&nbsp;


**Fire.** A non-magical fire that is at least 10 cubic feet in size can be absorbed to replenish a spell slot. This can only be done once per short rest.

Alternatively, you can spend a sorcery point to flare up the fire to impose disadvantage on an incoming attack roll against a creature who can see the fire.

&nbsp;


Any combination of the defensive options can only be used a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier. All uses of this feature recharge on a long rest.

```
```

#### Elemental Fury

Starting at 18th level, you can change the casting of any spell from the Elementalist Spell List table into a bonus action casting time. Additionally, you can perform the following maneuvers at the cost of 3 sorcerer points.

&nbsp;


**Hurricane Winds.** You attempt to push, pull, or lift 2 creatures within 30 feet of you as an action. If the creature is unwilling, they must succeed on a Strength saving throw to avoid being moved. On a fail, they are moved up to 30 feet. If the creature collides with a solid surface they take 2d12 bludgeoning damage, if the solid surface is another creature, that creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw. On a fail, they take the same thunder damage as the moved creature. On a save, they take half damage.

&nbsp;


**Vitality Fountain.** You create a 10ft. cube of breathable water within 10 feet that has healing properties as an action. Any creature that ends its turn in the bubble heals 2d8 hit points at the start of their turn. Maintaining this cube requires concentration as if it were a spell. This cube lasts for 1 minute or until concentration ends.

&nbsp;


**Granite Thorns.** You create a 25 foot line of spiked earth wall that juts out at enemies as an action. This effect can only be activated if there is earth or stone along the line you choose. Make a ranged spell attack roll against any hostile creatures within 5 feet of the wall and on any successful attack, the creatures take 3d10 bludgeoning damage.

&nbsp;


**Slumbering Sparks.** You send forth a spark of flame as an action up to 30 feet away to a creature. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw. On a fail, the sparks embeds itself into the creature, causing 2d8 fire damage immediately. On a save, they avoid the sparks and they float in midair until it is moved again as an action or after 1 minutes passes. As a bonus action, if the spark is within 60 feet and embedded into a creature, you can detonate it and cause an explosion in a 10 foot radius of it. All creatures within this range must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw, but the creature embedded with the sparks automatically fails. On a fail, a creature takes 3d8 fire damage, and half damage on a save. The sparks provide bright light in a 10ft. radius and dim light for an additional 10ft.

&nbsp;


You can use these features a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (Minimum of 1). All uses of this feature recharge on a long rest.

### False-Mind
When one steps back and looks at the world, they realize that it is different and unique to everyone. No two people see the same flower, or hear the same cry. Understanding this, it turns out, is the key to a convincing illusion. By reading the flow of life around all living things, Sorcerers of the False-Mind can cater an illusion to their recipients preferences. They can show things that shouldn’t be possible, and even fool other senses. After all, it isn’t the eyes you have to fool, but the mind behind them.

#### Trick of the Eye
Starting at 1st level, whenever you cast an illusion spell and a creature is affected by it or targets it for inspections, that creature suffers a -2 to Investigation checks against the illusions, and a -1 to saving throws to break through an illusion. Additionally, if an illusion is seen through or interacted with, you can choose for it to cause 1d6 psychic damage on the interacting or investigating creature so long as you can see the moment it is interacted with or seen through. This does not affect the spell Mirror Image.

At 14th level, this effect increases to a -3 to Investigation checks against the illusions, a -2 to saving throws, and the illusions can cause 2d6 psychic damage when they are interacted with or investigated. At 18th level, the damage increases to 3d8 psychic damage.

#### A Touch of Realism
Also starting at 1st level, choose one 1st level illusion spell to know in addition to your normal number of known spells from any spell list. Even if it isn’t from the Sorcerer spell list, it counts as a sorcerer spell for you. You can also use 2 Sorcerer Points to add a single attribute of smell, sound, or temperature to an illusion that normally would not have it as part of the casting.

At 6th level, you can spend 2 sorcery points to impose disadvantage on a creatures Investigation or Perception check against an illusion spell you cast so long as you can see them.

#### Honed Mind
At 6th level, you are fully trained in the way of the mind, granting you the following bonuses.
* You have advantage to saving throws against being Charmed
* You have immunity from Fear from magical sources
* You have advantages on skill checks and saving throws against Illusion spells.
* If you take psychic damage, you can choose to spend sorcery points to reduce the damage by 2d6 per point spent.

```
```
#### Inception
At 14th level, you can try and convince a target that it wants to do something contrary to its current course of action. As an action, you can speak to a creature and suggest to it another course of action in 10 words or less. To do so successfully, a Creature must fail on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC, and additionally, you must succeed on a Deception check against the creatures passive Insight (10+Insight). The creature must be able to hear you, share a same language as you, and have at least an Intelligence of 4. The creature will not listen to obviously detrimental suggestions such as harming itself or an ally. If this feature is successful, the creature does not know you influenced it ever, and believes its actions or train of thought was its own idea.

#### Mass Mirror Image
At 18th level, as an action you can provide yourself and up to 3 allies within 60 feet with duplicates from the spell Mirror Image. Choose from yourself and your chosen allies for one of you to receive 3 duplicates, another receive 2 duplicates, and the last 2 chosen receive 1 duplicate. You can use this ability once per long rest.

## Warlock
With the reshaping of the world, entities from beyond the planes have come forth to stake their claim. These entities act as Patrons to those able to reach out to them, and are willing to accept new power in exchange for their service. What these forces want is not always understood, but they are sure to let their wards know when they are stepping out of line. What these beings are capable of is unknown, but based on the abilities of their charges, they should be watched with full attention.

### The Nameless

You have made a pact with an entity stripped of form, and name. Only raw emotion and willpower remain, and you are its new instrument of influence. This entity desires that a ruthless justice and truth of the world be followed through against transgressors to promises or secretes. To this end, it will allow you to touch the hearts of others to bring to the surface the secrets they keep to hide their true selves from the world. Knowledge is sacred, and those who would hide it are the scum of the land.

#### Expanded Spell List
The Nameless lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

##### The Nameless Expanded Spells
| Paladin Level | Spells |
|:----:|:-------------|

| 2nd  | Darkness, Zone of Truth |
| 3rd  | Bestow Curse, Remove Curse |
| 4th  | Blight, Phantasmal Killer |
| 5th  | Hold Monster, Destructive Wave |



#### The Words of the World
At 1st level, Your Patron shares with you the secrets of truths and lies that mortals tell. You gain advantage on all Insight, and Deception skill checks. You also have the ability to lie while under the influence of Zone of Truth without alerting the caster to the fact that you are lying. You can do this by succeeding on a Wisdom saving throw against their spell save DC

#### Blood Oath
At 6th level, you learn the secrets of empathy and infuse your magic with it. As a reaction, you can swear a Blood Oath of Vengeance against the creature that last damaged you. A creature you have Blood Oathed is now linked to you. Until you or that creature drops to 0 hit points, or 1 minute passes, that creature takes 1d6 Psychic damage for every 5 points of health you lose from the moment of swearing the Oath up to a maximum of 5 times your Warlock level. You can only have 1 creature be targeted with this feature at a time. A creature can only have a Blood Oath sworn on it once every hour.

```
```

#### Secrets Revealed
At 10th level, you hear whispers from the Ethereal Plane on the battlefield about your foes; whispers of their weaknesses. As a bonus action, you can focus your attention on the whispers and gain advantage on attack rolls against a foe of your choice that you can see for 1 hour. This creature also suffers disadvantage to saving throws from spells cast by you. This feature can be used once per long rest

#### Loss of Identity
At 14th level, your Patron seeks to have others suffer its own demise. As an action, you can banish a non-undead foe as if casting the spell Banishment and send them to your Patron. Your target is torn apart at the mind as your Patron forces them to live the travesties and injustices of countless lives. Your target takes 1d4+1 psychic damage per Warlock level. At the end of your next turn, the target returns to the space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space. Should the creature die during this experience, their body is not returned and you instead receive temporary hit points equal to your Warlock level. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. A creature subjected to this experience can never undergo it again.

Entities responsible for the oversight of Dragons and their kin are Io, Aasterinian, Astilabor, Bahamut, Chronepsis, Faluzure, Garyx, Hlal, Lendys, Sardior, Tamara, and Tiamat. Regardless of your origin, you have piqued their interest when you contacted them and they have decided to grant you some of their power to see how things unfold. Through your tenacity and determination you now walk among society with the power of Dragon blood flowing through your veins, and an ability with the arcane to match.

Choose one type of dragon from the Draconic Ancestry table. Breath weapon and damage resistance are determined by the dragon type, as shown in the table.
	
##### Draconic Ancestry
| Dragon | Damage Type | Breath Weapon |
|:------:|:------------|:--------------|
| Black  | Acid | 5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. Save) |
| Blue  | Lightning | 5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. Save) |
| Brass  | Fire | 5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. Save) |
| Bronze  | Lightning | 5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. Save) |
| Copper  | Acid | 5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. Save) |
| Gold  | Fire | 15 ft. cone (Dex. save) |
| Green  | Poison | 15 ft. cone (Dex. save) |
| Red  | Fire | 15 ft. cone (Dex. save) |
| Silver  | Cold | 15 ft. cone (Dex. save) |
| White  | Cold | 15 ft. cone (Dex. save) |

```
```

#### Breath Weapon    
You can use your action to exhale destructive energy. Your draconic ancestry determines the size, shape, and damage type of the exhalation. When you use your breath weapon, each creature in the area of the exhalation must make a saving throw, the type of which is determined by your draconic ancestry. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level. After you use your breath weapon, you can’t use it again until you complete a short or long rest.

If you already have Draconic Ancestry from another source, you may choose a second Dragon type to benefit from, and can use both types for your breath weapon as you see fit. This also doubles how often you can use your breath weapon.

Lastly, you also can speak, read, and write Draconic.


#### Traits of the Drake
At 6th level, you are now comfortable enough with the draconic magic within you that you are constantly channeling it and some new side effects manifest as a result. You gain the following benefits.

* You grow patches of scales that cover your body now. Your AC without armor becomes 13+Dex. Modifier. At 10th level, you gain more scales and your AC increases to 14+Dex.
* Your Eldritch Blasts now deal 1d4 additional damage of the element based on your Draconic Heritage chosen for this subclass. This increases to 1d6 at 10th level.
* Resistance to the damage type of your draconic ancestry.

#### Born Within
At 10th level, you gain the ability to sprout wings at will for 5 minutes each day. These wings grant you a fly speed of 20 ft.

Additionally, your Evocations that affect your Eldritch Blast can now be used with your Breath Weapon with the exception of Eldritch Spear.

#### Herald of the Dragon
At 14th level, You can open a flaming 10 by 10 foot portal on the ground next to you, to summon forth the lurching head of a dragon, gifted to you in aid by your Patron. The dragon resembles the same type as you chose from Draconic Heritage. The Dragon’s stats are as stated below and has its own initiative order, but it is immovable from its summoned location. At the time of being summoned, the dragon occupies a 10 foot cube area, but can extend its neck another 10 feet from the portal. You can communicate with the dragon in Draconic, and it will listen to your orders and requests so long as it is not self-harming.

Your breath weapon is empowered while you are within 5 feet of the Dragon’s head, increasing its power by 3d6 and increasing its ange by 10 feet.

### The Vessel of the Lost

You have made a pact with the lost souls of the Void between planes to be their vessel. They scream out to you and beckon you to give them life, if only for just a while. You are able to reach out to them by making a deal with their protector and watcher, who in exchange for servicing his subjects with an answer to their cries, you may borrow their strengths and powers. With this, you become a jack of all trades, continuously warping your own mind by melding it with others, but inheriting their skill sets in the process.

#### Expanded Spell List
The Lost lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

##### The Vessel of the Lost Expanded Spells
| Paladin Level | Spells |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 1st  | Blade Ward, False Life |
| 2nd  | Calm Emotions, Mind Spike |
| 3rd  | Protection from Energy, Spirit Guardians |
| 4th  | Locate Creature, Phantasmal Killer |
| 5th  | Dominate Person, Raise Dead |


#### Harbored Soul
At 1st level, You now become a vessel to harbor a soul from beyond the Material Plane. Who you channel is sometimes hard to control, but regardless of who it is, it is always brief, so not too dangerous. As an action, roll 1d6 to determine whether you have control on what soul you select.

The soul that inhabits you acts at half of your current Warlock level (Minimum of 1) for the purposes of the strength of their abilities you gain.

When you harbor a soul, you gain temporary hit points equal to their Hit Die as their vitality fills you. Additionally, you learn the race of the soul you are harboring, and learn 1 language that they know if they know an additional language you don’t know already (DM’s discretion).
  
If a soul lets you learn a spell, you can only learn spells that would be available to that class at the stated level. All knowledge, ability, and proficiency of the gained abilities leave you along with the summoned soul after 1 hour or once you dismiss the soul as an action.

You can only harbor 1 soul at a time, and trying to harbor a new soul fails to yield results. The soul also leaves you if you become unconscious. Sometimes a bit of the souls personality may fuse into yours during the joined time together,but that is up to the DM’s discretion. You can use this feature a number of times equal to the number of Warlock Spell Slots you have.

| 1d6 | Result |
|:----:|:-------------:|
| 1-2  | Randomly select what Class the soul you harbor is from the table below by rolling 1d12 |
| 3-6  | Choose which soul to harbor based on Class |

```
```

#### Harbored Soul Selection
| 1d12 | Class | Hit Die | Gained Abilities from Harbored Soul|

#### Phantom Assist
At 6th level, you can set loose your Harbored soul into an enemy within 5 feet that has an Intelligence of at least 4, as an action. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the soul move into them. Because they are not accustomed to harboring an additional soul, they will have to roll on the Phantom Assist Table below and have that effect happen immediately. If the Creature succeeds on their saving throw, the soul will rejoin with you at the start of your next turn.

#### Phantom Assist Table
| 1d4 | Result |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 1 | The creature becomes feared by all other creatures. It remains feared until it succeeds on a subsequent saving throw at the end of its turns. |
| 2 | The creature disarms itself and cannot use bonus actions or reactions until the start of your next turn. The soul then leaves. |
| 3 | The creature takes 2d6 psychic damage but then expels the spirit. This increases to 2d8 psychic damage at 14th level. |
| 4 | The creature is able to push out the soul, forcing it to leave, but has disadvantage on its next attack roll while they recover from the experience. |


While a creature has the harbored soul within it, you do not benefit from their bonuses, but neither does the creature they inhabit. You can recall the soul back to you as an action if the creature is within 5 feet of you and the soul hasn’t left yet.

#### Stronger souls
At 10th level, the bonus to ability scores granted by souls increases to +3 (to a maximum of 20).

Additionally, whenever you have to roll a d12 for Harbored Soul, you may roll 2d12's and use either result.

```
```

#### Possession
At 14th level, your Patron teaches you the secret of moving souls yourself, allowing you to move yours to invade another's.

As an action, you attempt to invade a creature through a Charisma contest between you and a creature within 10 feet you can see that has less than your amount of current hit points.

If the creature has taken the Attack action in the last 5 minutes, you have disadvantage on this contest roll. If the creature is Frightened, Grappled, Restrained, or Stunned, you gain a +1 bonus to your contest roll. If the creature is Incapacitated, Petrified, or Unconscious, they are immune to this ability and cannot be targeted for a soul transfer.

If you attempt to possess a creature, but their hit points are more than your current hit points or you lose the contest, the possession is unsuccessful and unavailable for 24 hours.

If you succeed in sending your soul to the creature, you gain their stat block and current health points and can remain within their body for 5 minutes. You take their place in initiative during this time. You do not gain any of their memories, or learn any of their languages, features, or spells if you do not already know them yourself. If they do not have spell slots, you cannot use any of your spellcasting abilities.

While you are possessing a body, your own goes limp and is unconscious. If you are reduced to 0 hit points in the body you are occupying, your soul returns to your original body so long as it is on the same plane of existence and not dead. upon such time, you immediately take any leftover damage beyond what reduced your possessed body to 0 as psychic damage. If your original body is reduced to 0 hit points, or 5 minutes passes, you are pulled back into it immediately so long as you are on the same plane of existence as it. If you are not on the same plane of existence when you are pulled back to your body, your soul lingers in place where your body last was until your body returns to the same plane of existence.

You must succeed on another Charisma contest at the end of each of your turns using the body in order to keep possessing it. On a fail, you are forced out by the host and take 1d8 psychic damage per turn you occupied it.

## Wizard
With so much changing in the world, the knowledge to be sought seems truly infinite. But one can strive for the impossible, and will witness many a miracle along the way. The ultimate seekers of knowledge who delve themselves into the study and practice of magic are capable of wonderous creations and abilities. Yet they remain unsatisfied, as they know that there will always be more to learn and create.


### School of Animation
Your studies as a transmutation mage has brought your attention to the fact that objects can be manipulated to imitate life. Usually this discovery starts out with a simple curiosity if an assistant can be made to help with arcane pursuits, while others see a means of protection. After a while, some of these desires and wonders can expand to questionable morals or building an army of constructs, or a single, all powerful golem.

### Transmutation Savant
Starting at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy a transmutation spell into your spellbook is halved. You gain proficiency in Smith’s Tools, Carpenter’s Tool’s and Mason’s Tools.

### Personal Touch
Starting at 2nd level when you choose this school, you add the Find Familiar spell to your spellbook if you do not already have it, and can cast it without the normal material cost. When you cast the spell, you can choose to sacrifice 2 pounds worth of material to create the familiar as a Construct with certain extra properties depending on what material was used

#### Construct Properties
| Material | Property |
|----------|----------|
|Fiber|Has a fly speed of 10 feet|
|Stone|Gains an additional 2d8 maximum hit points|
|Metal|Gains +2 to AC|
|Crystal/Gem|Can cast 2nd level magic missile once per long rest|

```
```

#### Selfmade Soldiers
Starting at 6th level, As an action, you can use a 2nd level spell slot to animate a non-magical weapon or non-magical armor that is not being worn or carried that you touch. A weapon has the statistics of a Flying Sword, and a piece of armor has the statistics of an Animated Armor.

The weapon or armor becomes a creature under your control for 1 hour or until the creature is reduced to 0 hit points. At the start or end of the creatures turn , if it is more than 30 feet from you, it returns to being a non-magical item and can’t be reanimated for 1 hour.

As a bonus action, you can mentally control your animation. You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular room. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the construct continues to follow it until its task is complete or the animation wears off.

An animated weapon or armor becomes brittle and unusable after the animation effect has ended, becoming broken equipment

At 10th level, you can also cast transmutation spells from these constructs if they are within 30 feet.

#### Focused Animation
Beginning at 10th level, you can now infuse a familiar summoned with Find Familiar with 2 materials to grant it extra properties. Additionaly you can now cast transmutation spells from your familiar without it having a range of touch.

#### True Construct
Starting at 14th level you learn the spell Stone Shape if you do not already know it, but you can now use it to also affect wood and metal, and crystals/gems for the purposes of this feature. Whenever you touch at least 10 cubic feet worth of metal, crystal/gems ,wood, or stone, you can cast Stone Shape and spend 1 hour to morph it into a True Construct. True constructs have the following properties:
* They do not need concentration to be maintained
* They remain alive until they break or are reduced to 0 hit points.
* They use our Spell save DC for their features.

You can mentally command a True Construct you create if it is within 100 feet of you. A true construct will follow your instructions to the best of its ability. You might command the construct to accompany you on an adventure, to guard a location, deliver a package, etc. When a true construct has completed its instructions, it will travel to you if you are on the same plane of existence. If you are on a different plane of existence, it returns to the place it was last instructed to stay or where it was animated until you return.

You can only have one Construct under your command at a time. If you try to create another while you have one, it will not come to life. True Constructs have their own initiative separate from you in encounters. They do not need to eat or sleep, and cannot communicate to you physically or mentally, though it understands you perfectly. 

True Constructs cannot be healed by means other than being worked on by their relevant tool kit. With 1 pounds worth of material, you can heal a Metal construct with Smith’s Tools,  A Crystal/Gem construct with Jeweler’s Tools, a Wooden construct with Carpenter’s Tools, and a Stone construct with Mason’s Tools.

The amount of healing is equal to the number rolled for the relevant tool kit set skill check made with the tools. It takes one hour to make the repairs to your True Construct.

True constructs are not immune to the ravages of time and thus decay at the rate of the objects they are made of. As the constructs condition worsens, its maximum hit points decrease. If the construct reaches 0 hit points, the effect ends and the now lifeless material is no longer eligible to be used to make a new True Construct. Metal decays 1d12 health per year. Crystal/Gem decays at 2d6 per month, Stone decays 1d12 health per month. And wood decays 1d12 health every week. You can create a True construct once every 7 days.

### School of Force
The manifestation of arcana as a physcial force is not the most difficult thing to do, but maintaining it perfectly instead of having it be a fleeting single motion is art. Wizards of the School of Force are masters at manipulating the arcane energy around them to phase into a near solid force. This assists them in feats of extra protection, and even achieving improved strength for themselves. When the intangible becomes tangible, the possibilities open up to near infinite new avenues to explore.


#### Expertise in Force
Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy a conjuration spell into your spellbook is halved.

#### Fist de Cuffs
Additionally at 2nd level, you gain the Improved Mage Hand cantrip, and it does not count against the number of cantrips you can know.

#### Protective Force
Starting at 6th level, Whenever you cast a Conjuration spell, a residual charge of magic protects you after the spells casting for 1 minute. This charge grants you a +1 to AC and, if an attack damages you, 1d4 damage mitigation. Upon taking damage, or 1 minute passing, the charge fades from you.

Should an attack that inflicts force damage target you while your AC is increased from a charge of this feature, your magic negates the force damage, adding an additional +1 to your AC to a maximum of +3 instead.

#### Handy Casting
Beginning at 10th level, You can now place your Improved Mage Hand over your own hands. When you do so, your Strength score increases by +2, and you have advantage on any Strength ability checks and saving throws. Any spell attacks you cast while your mage hand is over your own gains +1d4 force damage.


#### Fists of the Mage
Starting at 14th level, You can conjure 2 muscular Mage hands and arms over your own, and 2 others appear from your back and reach around to your front as a bonus action, glowing with intense power for 1 minute. While you have Fists of the Mage active, you add +2 to AC, your unarmed strikes gaint he following attributes:

* Have a reach of 10 ft.
* Gain a bonus +5 to hit
* Deal 2d4+Strength mod. Force damage.

You gain the Multiattack feature if you use the attack action to make an unarmed strike, allowing you to make 4 attacks with your unarmed strikes.

You also have advantage on all Strength saving throws or strength checks, and a temporary bonus of +3 to your Strength Score for those saving throws or checks.

If you are the sole target of a ranged spell attack while Fists of the Mage is active, you can make a Dexterity saving throw equal to 9 + the casters bonus to spell attacks to block it with your force hands to reduce the damage by half your Wizard level+2.

You can conjure Fists of the Mage 2 times. All uses of this feature recharge on a long rest.

### School of Alchemy

#### Expertise in Chemistry
Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, you gain proficiency with Alchemy tools and one other toolset of your choice, along with the Survival skill. You have advantage when trying to identify the effects of a potion or similar mixture. Creating potions with an alchemy kit allows you to add your proficiency bonus to any damaging or healing effects they include. Ingredients can be obtained at an alchemy shop, or by foraging in nature for 2 hours using a Survival skill check to find 10 gp worth of ingredients. You can only forage in an area once per day.


#### Hasty Concoction
Additionally at 2nd level, you can throw together ingredients quickly to get a potion of suitable effects, but you have to act fast. As an action, use 10gp worth of ingredients, to create a potion from the Hasty Concoction Potion Table.

The potion effects can only be activated within 1 minute after being created, and turns into a foul smelling mixture after that time that gives no additional effect. To make a potion, you must have an empty bottle, vial, or other suitable container. When you throw a potion, the potions are treated as Simple melee Weapons with a Thrown range of 15/30 feet.

Roll 1d20 to see which potion you create. If you instead spend 4 hours with an alchemy kit, you can select a specific potion to create from the list below whose effects stay eligible for activation for 8 hours.

#### Long Range Administration
Starting at 6th level, you gain proficiency with Hand crossbows, and can now fuse a Hasty Concoction potion into the tip of a crossbow bolt as a bonus action. This causes the next shot of that crossbow to apply the potion effect as part of the weapon attack if it hits. If the bolt is not used within 1 minute the effects fade.

If the potion effects an area, the target of the weapon attack roll becomes the source location for the potion effect to activate from regardless if the attack roll hit or not.

#### Efficient Chemistry
Beginning at 10th level, Any potions you craft that involve dealing damage or healing have their amount of dice doubled. Additionally, the cost of crafting potions is now cut to 5gp. If you still spend 10gp worth however, you can roll your Hasty Concoction feature with advantage and take either result.

#### Mad Doctor
Starting at 14th level, You can spend 1 hr, instead of 4 hours, to craft a potion that will last 24 hours instead of only 8. Additionally, you can fuse 2 separate potions together as an action by using your magic to keep them contained in the same container, but still independent of one another. This will activate both potions simultaneously whenever they are activated by drinking or by breaking.

Any potions you craft that involve dealing damage or healing now add your Intelligence modifier to their damage or healing.

- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Components:** S, V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Using both of your hands and a full breath, you extend your arms forward to assault a creature within range with an assault of air forcing the creature to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save they are pushed 5 feet times your spellcasting ability modifier away from you and if the creature collides with a solid surface or creature, they take 1d4+1 Thunder damage for every 5 feet of remaining movement that hasn’t been used by it from the push.

If the creature collides with a second creature, the second creature must make a Str. saving throw or take half of the Thunder damage the original creature takes from being thrown. On a successful save it is only moved 5 feet and can take no damage.

If a Large creature is targeted, it is pushed back -10 feet than it normally would. A Huge or larger creature cannot be affected by this spell.

***At Higher Levels.*** The spell gains a bonus 1d4 Thunder damage to the primary target if they failed the saving throw when you reach 5th level (1d4), 11th level (2d4), and 17th level (3d4).

Creatures who you successfully attack are hurt for 1d8 fire damage and are burned. Burning creatures take 1d8 fire damage at the start of their turn and can make a Constitution saving throw at the end of its turn. On a successful save, the burning ends for it.

***Magmatic Force***  If you cast Earthen Pillar before using this spell on the same turn, your pillar gains molten cracks and explodes at the end of your turn if it is within range of this attack. Creatures restrained by the pillar take 1d8 fire damage, and then they proceed to fall. Creatures not restrained by the pillar, but within 5 feet of it when it explodes must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw. Creatures take 1d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful save.
