### Background

Almost 1400 years ago the world known as Faerun was rewritten. The land masses changed by the power of gods, and the established cities of power and splendor were casualties of great conflict. The hubris of the Kings and Queens of Faerun bred ill-content and condemnation from various pockets in the world, til groups clashed and sought powers the knew not how to control. Deities, never meant to share our plane, were summoned and used as tools of determent and rights of rule. 
Raegiir, King of Amn, replacement of the Council of Six, gained support from Lord Ao, the Being of Light. 
Ralan Pesarkhal, King of Calimshan won the favor of Grumbar, the God of Elemental Earth and Oaths, and etugen, Grumbars aspect who was regarded as goddess of earth, pastures, and herds. 
Yaevet, Queen of Chessenta, was guided by Lathander, the God of Spring, youth, birth, and vitality. 
Strenton, King of Chondath, formed alliances with Waukeen, Goddess of Trade, and Malar, the God of the Hunt. 
And lastly Queen Xiadorma of Damara won over Talos, God of Storms, and Tempus, God of War and warriors.

Soon, all the Monarchs had at least one God or Goddess on their side, as they eyed one another on who would make the first move. But an outside group, known only as The Memorum, unleashed three gods unto the world. Bane, the Black Lord, God of hatred, fear, and Tyranny. Cyric, God of Murder, Lies, and Deception. and Lolth, Goddess of Drowm Spiders, Chaos and Evil. Together, they caused destruction, havoc and reaping fear amongst the Monarchs. They started fighting each other, thinking their rivals had finally started the battle. Towns were devastated, armies became irrelevant. Only champions so bold, and the deities and their blessings mattered now. After a month of war, the Monarchs wanted a truce and to rebuild as one kingdom, as none were in a condition to survive anymore. When the accord was to be made however, The Memorum struck, unleashing the three Deities aligned with their cause again in a coordinated attack. All the Monarchs were slain, their pacts broken with their Deities, who then retreated to their respective Planes. And the Memorum were never seen again. For another year the world would continue to be a dangerous place. Seas rising, Mountains crumbling and Volcanoes releasing their fury. By the time the world was calming, three cities of notoriety rose. Umbra in the new continent of Calimsar, Presido, in the old land of Amn, and Gassiron in Damara. As time would march forward, so would the cycle repeat itself. Cities expanded and boundaries were drawn. But the largest a war would progress in 1000 years would be 3 battles long with 600 casualties. Each year that progressed promised for the past to be forgotten more and more. Outside city walls or cleared areas the world remained dangerous however. Ancient magic lingers in the world, and nobody knows all of what is out there.
